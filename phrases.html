<h3 id="id00047" style="margin-top: 3em">INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p id="id00048">The most powerful and the most perfect expression of thought and feeling
through the medium of oral language must be traced to the mastery of
words. Nothing is better suited to lead speakers and readers of English
into an easy control of this language than the command of the phrase that
perfectly expresses the thought. Every speaker's aim is to be heard and
understood. A clear, crisp articulation holds an audience as by the spell
of some irresistible power. The choice word, the correct phrase, are
instruments that may reach the heart, and awake the soul if they fall upon
the ear in melodious cadence; but if the utterance be harsh and discordant
they fail to interest, fall upon deaf ears, and are as barren as seed sown
on fallow ground. In language, nothing conduces so emphatically to the
harmony of sounds as perfect phrasing—that is, the emphasizing of the
relation of clause to clause, and of sentence to sentence by the
systematic grouping of words. The phrase consists usually of a few words
which denote a single idea that forms a separate part of a sentence. In
this respect it differs from the clause, which is a short sentence that
forms a distinct part of a composition, paragraph, or discourse. Correct
phrasing is regulated by rests, such rests as do not break the continuity
of a thought or the progress of the sense.</p>

<p id="id00049">GRENVILLE KLEISER, who has devoted years of his diligent life to imparting
the art of correct expression in speech and writing, has provided many
aids for those who would know not merely what to say, but how to say it.
He has taught also what the great HOLMES taught, that language is a temple
in which the human soul is enshrined, and that it grows out of life—out
of its joys and its sorrows, its burdens and its necessities. To him, as
well as to the writer, the deep strong voice of man and the low sweet
voice of woman are never heard at finer advantage than in the earnest but
mellow tones of familiar speech. In the present volume Mr. Kleiser
furnishes an additional and an exceptional aid for those who would have a
mint of phrases at their command from which to draw when in need of the
golden mean for expressing thought. Few indeed are the books fitted to-day
for the purpose of imparting this knowledge, yet two centuries ago
phrase-books were esteemed as supplements to the dictionaries, and have
not by any manner of means lost their value. The guide to familiar
quotations, the index to similes, the grammars, the readers, the
machine-made letter-writer of mechanically perfect letters of
congratulation or condolence—none are sententious enough to supply the
need. By the compilation of this praxis, Mr. Kleiser has not only supplied
it, but has furnished a means for the increase of one's vocabulary by
practical methods. There are thousands of persons who may profit by the
systematic study of such a book as this if they will familiarize
themselves with the author's purpose by a careful reading of the
preliminary pages of his book. To speak in public pleasingly and readily
and to read well are accomplishments acquired only after many days, weeks
even, of practise.</p>

<p id="id00050">Foreigners sometimes reproach us for the asperity and discordance of our
speech, and in general, this reproach is just, for there are many persons
who do scanty justice to the vowel-elements of our language. Although
these elements constitute its music they are continually mistreated. We
flirt with and pirouette around them constantly. If it were not so,
English would be found full of beauty and harmony of sound. Familiar with
the maxim, "Take care of the vowels and the consonants will take care of
themselves,"—a maxim that when put into practise has frequently led to
the breaking-down of vowel values—the writer feels that the common custom
of allowing "the consonants to take care of themselves" is pernicious. It
leads to suppression or to imperfect utterance, and thus produces
indistinct articulation.</p>

<p id="id00051">The English language is so complex in character that it can scarcely be
learned by rule, and can best be mastered by the study of such idioms and
phrases as are provided in this book; but just as care must be taken to
place every accent or stress on the proper syllable in the pronouncing of
every word it contains, so must the stress or emphasis be placed on the
proper word in every sentence spoken. To read or speak pleasingly one
should resort to constant practise by doing so aloud in private, or
preferably, in the presence of such persons as know good reading when they
hear it and are masters of the melody of sounds. It was Dean Swift's
belief that the common fluency of speech in many men and most women was
due to scarcity of matter and scarcity of words. He claimed that a master
of language possessed a mind full of ideas, and that before speaking, such
a mind paused to select the choice word—the phrase best suited to the
occasion. "Common speakers," he said, "have only one set of ideas, and one
set of words to clothe them in," and these are always ready on the lips.
Because he holds the Dean's view sound to-day, the writer will venture to
warn the readers of this book against a habit that, growing far too common
among us, should be checked, and this is the iteration and reiteration in
conversation of "the battered, stale, and trite" phrases, the like of
which were credited by the worthy Dean to the women   of his time.</p>

<p id="id00052">Human thought elaborates itself with the progress of intelligence. Speech
is the harvest of thought, and the relation which exists between words and
the mouths that speak them must be carefully observed. Just as nothing is
more beautiful than a word fitly spoken, so nothing is rarer than the use
of a word in its exact meaning. There is a tendency to overwork both words
and phrases that is not restricted to any particular class. The learned
sin in this respect even as do the ignorant, and the practise spreads
until it becomes an epidemic. The epidemic word with us yesterday was
unquestionably "conscription"; several months ago it was "preparedness."
Before then "efficiency" was heard on every side and succeeded in
superseding "vocational teaching," only to be displaced in turn by "life
extension" activities. "Safety-first" had a long run which was brought
almost to abrupt end by "strict accountability," but these are mere
reflections of our cosmopolitan life and activities. There are others that
stand out as indicators of brain-weariness. These are most frequently met
in the work of our novelists.</p>

<p id="id00053">English authors and journalists are abusing and overworking the word
intrigue to-day. Sir Arthur Quillercouch on page 81 of his book "On the
Art of Writing" uses it: "We are intrigued by the process of manufacture
instead of being wearied by a description of the ready-made article." Mrs.
Sidgwick in "Salt and Savour," page 232, wrote: "But what intrigued her
was Little Mamma's remark at breakfast," From the Parliamentary news, one
learns that "Mr. Harcourt intrigued the House of Commons by his sustained
silence for two years" and that "London is interested in, and not a little
intrigued, by the statement." This use of intrigue in the sense of
"perplex, puzzle, trick, or deceive" dates from 1600. Then it fell into a
state of somnolence, and after an existence of innocuous desuetude lasting
till 1794 it was revived, only to hibernate again until 1894. It owes its
new lease of life to a writer on The Westminster Gazette, a London journal
famous for its competitions in aid of the restoring of the dead meanings
of words.</p>

<p id="id00054">One is almost exasperated by the repeated use and abuse of the word
"intimate" in a recently published work of fiction, by an author who
aspires to the first rank in his profession. He writes of "the intimate
dimness of the room;" "a fierce intimate whispering;" "a look that was
intimate;" "the noise of the city was intimate," etc. Who has not heard,
"The idea!" "What's the idea?" "Is that the idea?" "Yes, that's the idea,"
with increased inflection at each repetition. And who is without a friend
who at some time or another has not sprung "meticulous" upon him? Another
example is afforded by the endemic use of "of sorts" which struck London
while the writer was in that city a few years ago. Whence it came no one
knew, but it was heard on every side. "She was a woman of sorts;" "he is a
Tory of sorts;" "he had a religion of sorts;" "he was a critic of sorts."
While it originally meant "of different or various kinds," as hats of
sorts; offices of sorts; cheeses of sorts, etc., it is now used
disparagingly, and implies something of a kind that is not satisfactory,
or of a character that is rather poor. This, as Shakespeare might have
said, is "Sodden business! There's a stewed phrase indeed!" [Footnote:
Troilus and Cressida, act iii, sc. 1.]</p>

<p id="id00055">The abuse of phrases and the misuse of words rife among us can be checked
by diligent exercises in good English, such as this book provides. These
exercises, in conjunction with others to be found in different volumes by
the same author, will serve to correct careless diction and slovenly
speech, and lead to the art of speaking and writing correctly; for, after
all, accuracy in the use of words is more a matter of habit than of
theory, and once it is acquired it becomes just as easy to speak or to
write good English as bad English. It was Chesterfield's resolution not to
speak a word in conversation which was not the fittest he could recall.
All persons should avoid using words whose meanings they do not know, and
with the correct application of which they are unfamiliar. The best spoken
and the best written English is that which conforms to the language as
used by men and women of culture—a high standard, it is true, but one not
so high that it is unattainable by any earnest student of the English
tongue.
FRANK H. VIZETELLY.</p>

<h3 id="id00056" style="margin-top: 3em">HOW TO USE THIS BOOK</h3>

<p id="id00057">The study of words, phrases, and literary expressions is a highly
interesting pursuit. There is a reciprocal influence between thought and
language. What we think molds the words we use, and the words we use react
upon our thoughts. Hence a study of words is a study of ideas, and a
stimulant to deep and original thinking.</p>

<p id="id00058">We should not, however, study "sparkling words and sonorous phrases" with
the object of introducing them consciously into our speech. To do so would
inevitably lead to stiltedness and superficiality. Words and phrases
should be studied as symbols of ideas, and as we become thoroughly
familiar with them they will play an unconscious but effective part in our
daily expression.</p>

<p id="id00059">We acquire our vocabulary largely from our reading and our personal
associates. The words we use are an unmistakable indication of our thought
habits, tastes, ideals, and interests in life. In like manner, the
habitual language of a people is a barometer of their intellectual, civil,
moral, and spiritual ideals. A great and noble people express themselves
in great and noble words.</p>

<p id="id00060">Ruskin earnestly counsels us to form the habit of looking intensely at
words. We should scrutinize them closely and endeavor to grasp their
innermost meaning. There is an indefinable satisfaction in knowing how to
choose and use words with accuracy and precision. As Fox once said, "I am
never at a loss for a word, but Pitt always has the word."</p>

<p id="id00061">All the great writers and orators have been diligent students of words.
Demosthenes and Cicero were indefatigable in their study of language.
Shakespeare, "infinite in faculty," took infinite pains to embody his
thought in words of crystal clearness. Coleridge once said of him that
one might as well try to dislodge a brick from a building with one's
forefinger as to omit a single word from one of his finest passages.</p>

<p id="id00062">Milton, master of majestic prose, under whose touch words became as living
things; Flaubert, who believed there was one and one only best word with
which to express a given thought; De Quincey, who exercised a weird-like
power over words; Ruskin, whose rhythmic prose enchanted the ear; Keats,
who brooded over phrases like a lover; Newman, of pure and melodious
style; Stevenson, forever in quest of the scrupulously precise word;
Tennyson, graceful and exquisite as the limpid stream; Emerson, of
trenchant and epigrammatic style; Webster, whose virile words sometimes
weighed a pound; and Lincoln, of simple, Saxon speech,—all these
illustrious men were assiduous in their study of words.</p>

<p id="id00063">Many persons of good education unconsciously circumscribe themselves
within a small vocabulary. They have a knowledge of hundreds of desirable
words which they do not put into practical use in their speech or writing.
Many, too, are conscious of a poverty of language, which engenders in them
a sense of timidity and self-depreciation. The method used for building a
large vocabulary has usually been confined to the study of single words.
This has produced good results, but it is believed that eminently better
results can be obtained from a careful study of words and expressions, as
furnished in this book, where words can be examined in their context.</p>

<p id="id00064">It is intended and suggested that this study should be pursued in
connection with, and as a supplement to, a good standard dictionary.
Fifteen minutes a day devoted to this subject, in the manner outlined,
will do more to improve and enlarge the vocabulary than an hour spent in
desultory reading.</p>

<p id="id00065">There is no better way in which to develop the mental qualities of
clearness, accuracy, and precision, and to improve and enlarge the
intellectual powers generally, than by regular and painstaking study of
judiciously selected phrases and literary expressions.</p>

<h5 id="id00066">PLAN OF STUDY</h5>

<p id="id00067">First examine the book in a general way to grasp its character, scope, and
purpose. Carefully note the following plan of classification of the
various kinds of phrases, and choose for initial study a section which you
think will be of the most immediate value to you.</p>

<h5 id="id00068">I.    USEFUL PHRASES
II.   SIGNIFICANT PHRASES
III.  FELICITOUS PHRASES
IV.   IMPRESSIVE PHRASES
V.    PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES
VI.   BUSINESS PHRASES
VII.  LITERARY EXPRESSIONS
VIII. STRIKING SIMILES
IX.   CONVERSATIONAL PHRASES
X.    PUBLIC SPEAKING PHRASES
XI.   MISCELLANEOUS PHRASES</h5>

<p id="id00069">There are many advantages in keeping before you a definite purpose in your
study of this book. A well-defined plan will act as an incentive to
regular and systematic effort, and incidentally develop your power of
concentration.</p>

<p id="id00070">It is desirable that you set apart a certain convenient time each day for
this study. Regularity tends to produce maximum results. As you progress
with this work your interest will be quickened and you will realize the
desirability of giving more and more time to this important subject.</p>

<p id="id00071">When you have chosen a section of the book which particularly appeals to
you, begin your actual study by reading the phrases aloud. Read them
slowly and understandingly. This tends to impress them more deeply upon
your mind, and is in itself one of the best and most practical ways of
acquiring a large and varied vocabulary. Moreover, the practise of
fitting words to the mouth rapidly develops fluency and facility of
speech.</p>

<p id="id00072">Few persons realize the great value of reading aloud. Many of the foremost
English stylists devoted a certain period regularly to this practise.
Cardinal Newman read aloud each day a chapter from Cicero as a means of
developing his ear for sentence-rhythm. Rufus Choate, in order to
increase his command of language, and to avoid sinking into mere empty
fluency, read aloud daily, during a large part of his life, a page or more
from some great English author. As a writer has said, "The practise of
storing the mind with choice passages from the best prose writers and
poets, and thus flavoring it with the essence of good literatures, is one
which is commended both by the best teachers and by the example of some of
the most celebrated orators, who have adopted it with signal success."</p>

<p id="id00073">This study should be pursued with pencil in hand, so that you may readily
underscore phrases which make a special appeal to you. The free use of a
pencil in marking significant parts of a book is good evidence of
thoroughness. This, too, will facilitate your work of subsequent review.</p>

<p id="id00074">The habit of regularly copying, in your own handwriting, one or more pages
of phrases will be of immense practical value. This exercise is a great
aid in developing a facile English style. The daily use of the pen has
been recommended in all times as a valuable means of developing oral and
literary expression.</p>

<p id="id00075">A helpful exercise is to pronounce a phrase aloud and then fit it into a
complete sentence of your own making. This practice gives added facility
and resourcefulness in the use of words.</p>

<p id="id00076">As an enthusiastic student of good English, you should carefully note
striking and significant phrases or literary expressions which you find in
your general reading. These should be set down in a note-book reserved for
this exclusive purpose. In this way you can prepare many lists of your
own, and thus greatly augment the value of this study.</p>

<p id="id00077">The taste for beauty, truth, and harmony in language can be developed by
careful study of well-selected phrases and literary expressions as
furnished in this book. A good literary style is formed principally by
daily study of great English writers, by careful examination of words in
their context, and by a discriminating use of language at all times.</p>

rung far down under the humming waters</p>

<p id="id10095">Some gleams of feeling pure and warm as sunshine on a sky of storm</p>

<p id="id10096">Some like veiled ghosts hurrying past
as though driven to their land of shadows by shuddering fear</p>

<p id="id10097">Some minds are like an open fire—how direct and instant
our communication with them</p>

<p id="id10098">Something divine seemed to cling around her like some subtle vapor</p>

<p id="id10099">Something resistant and inert, like the obstinate rolling over
of a heavy sleeper after he has been called to get up</p>

<p id="id10122">Sunbeams flashing on the face of things
like sudden smilings of divine delight</p>

an atmosphere of divine quietude</p>

<p id="id10166">The day stunned me like light upon some wizard way</p>

<p id="id10167">The day was sweeter than honey and the honey-comb</p>

<p id="id10168">The day have trampled me like armed men</p>

<p id="id10169">The dead past flew away over the fens like a flight of wild swans</p>

<p id="id10186">The gathering glory of life shone like the dawn</p>

<p id="id10187">The gesture was all strength and will,
like the stretching of a sea-bird's wings</p>

<p id="id10188">The girl's voice rang like a bird-call through his rustling fancies</p>

<p id="id10189">The glimmer of tall flowers standing
like pensive moon-worshipers in an ecstasy of prayerless bloom</p>

<p id="id10190">The guides sniffed, like chamois, the air<br>

<p id="id10194">The hours crawled by like years</p>

<p id="id10195">The hum of the camp sounds like the sea</p>

<p id="id10196">The hurrying crowds of men gather like clouds</p>

<p id="id10197">The ideas succeeded each other like a dynasty of kings</p>

<p id="id10198">The impalpable presence of the new century
rose like a vast empty house through which</p>

<p id="id10199">no human feet had walked</p>

<p id="id10200">The inexorable facts closed in on him
like prison-warders hand-cuffing a convict</p>

<p id="id10205">The light of London flaring like a dreary dawn</p>

<p id="id10206">The lights blazed up like day</p>

<p id="id10207">The lilies were drooping, white, and wan,
like the head and skin of a dying man</p>

<p id="id10208">The mellowing hand of time</p>

<p id="id10209">The melody rose tenderly and lingeringly
like a haunting perfume of pressed flowers</p>

<p id="id10214">The moonbeams rest like a pale spotless shroud</p>

<p id="id10215">The moonlight lay like snow</p>

<p id="id10216">The moonlight, like a fairy mist, upon the mesa spreads</p>

<p id="id10217">The mortal coldness of the soul, like death itself comes down</p>

<p id="id10218">The mountain shadows mingling, lay like pools above the earth</p>

<p id="id10219">The mountains loomed up dimly, like phantoms through the mist</p>

<p id="id10220">The music almost died away, then it burst like a pent-up flood</p>

<p id="id10221">The name that cuts into my soul like a knife</p>

<p id="id10222">The nervous little train winding its way like a jointed reptile</p>

<p id="id10223">The new ferns were spread upon the earth like some lacy coverlet</p>

<p id="id10226">The ocean swelled like an undulating mirror of the bowl of heaven</p>

<p id="id10227">The old books look somewhat pathetically from the shelves,
like aged dogs wondering why no one takes them for a walk</p>

<p id="id10228">The old infamy will pop into daylight
like a toad out of fissure in the rock</p>

<p id="id10229">The penalty falls like a thunderbolt from heaven</p>

<p id="id10230">The phrase was like a spear-thrust</p>

<p id="id10231">The pine trees waved as waves a woman's hair</p>

<p id="id10232">The place was like some enchanted town of palaces</p>

<p id="id10233">The plains to northward change their color
like the shimmering necks of doves</p>

<p id="id10234">The poppy burned like a crimson ember</p>

<p id="id10235">The prime of man has waxed like cedars</p>

<p id="id10236">The public press would chatter and make odd ambiguous sounds
like a shipload of monkeys in a storm</p>

<p id="id10239">The river shouted as ever its cry of joy over the vitality of life,
like a spirited boy before the face of inscrutable nature</p>

<p id="id10246">The sea spread out like a wrinkled marble floor</p>

<p id="id10247">The sea, that gleamed still, like a myriad-petaled rose</p>

<p id="id10248">The sea was as untroubled as the turquoise vault which it reflected</p>

<p id="id10249">The setting of the sun is like a word of peace</p>

<p id="id10250">The sharp hail rattles against the panes and melts on my cheeks like tears</p>

<p id="id10251">The ships, like sheeted phantoms coming and going</p>

<p id="id10252">The silence seemed to crush to earth
like a great looking-glass and shiver into a million pieces</p>

<p id="id10253">The silvery morning like a tranquil vision fills the world</p>

<p id="id10255">The sky gleamed with the hardness and brilliancy of blue enamel</p>

<p id="id10256">The sky was as a shield
that caught the stain of blood and battle from the dying sun</p>

<p id="id10257">The sky was clear and blue, and the air as soft as milk</p>

<p id="id10258">The sky was like a peach</p>

<p id="id10259">The sky where stars like lilies white and fair shine through the mists</p>

<p id="id10260">The solid air around me there heaved like a roaring ocean</p>

<p id="id10261">The solid mountains gleamed like the unsteady sea</p>

<p id="id10262">The soul is like a well of water springing up into everlasting life</p>

<p id="id10263">The sound is like a noon-day gale</p>

<p id="id10264">The sound is like a silver-fountain that springeth in a golden basin</p>

<p id="id10265">The sound of a thousand tears, like softly pattering wings</p>

<p id="id10266">The sound of your running feet that like the sea-hoofs beat</p>

<p id="id10267">The spear-tongued lightning slipped like a snake</p>

<p id="id10268">The Spring breaks like a bird</p>

<p id="id10269">The stacks of corn in brown array, like tattered wigwams on the plain</p>

<p id="id10270">The stars come down and trembling glow like blossoms on the waves below</p>

<p id="id10271">The stars lay on the lapis-lazuli sky<br>

like white flower-petals on still deep water<br>

<p id="id10273">The strange cold sense of aloofness that had numbed her senses
suddenly gave way like snow melting in the spring</p>

<p id="id10274">The sudden thought of your face is like a wound when it comes unsought</p>

<p id="id10275">The sun, like a great dragon, writhes in gold</p>

<p id="id10276">The sun on the sea-wave lies white as the moon</p>

<p id="id10277">The surf was like the advancing lines of an unknown enemy
flinging itself upon the shore</p>

<p id="id10278">The terrible past lay afar, like a dream left behind in the night</p>

<p id="id10279">The tide was in the salt-weed, and like a knife it tore</p>

<p id="id10280">The time, gliding like a dream</p>

<p id="id10281">The torrent from the hills
leaped down their rocky stairways like wild steeds</p>

<p id="id10282">The tree whose plumed boughs are soft as wings of birds</p>

<p id="id10283">The uproar and contention pierced him like arrows</p>

<p id="id10286">The villa dips its foot in the lake, smiling at its reflection
like a bather lingering on the brink</p>

<p id="id10287">The voice of Fate, crying like some old Bellman through the world</p>

<p id="id10289">The warm kindling blood burned her cheeks like the breath of a hot wind</p>

<p id="id10290">The waves were rolling in, long and lazy, like sea-worn travelers</p>

<p id="id10291">The whole truth, naked, cold, and fatal as a patriot's blade</p>

<p id="id10292">The wind all round their ears hissed like a flight of white-winged geese</p>

<p id="id10293">The wind comes and it draws its length along
like the genii from the earthen pot</p>

<p id="id10294">The wine flows like blood</p>

<p id="id10295">The woman seemed like a thing of stone</p>

<p id="id10296">The words kept ringing in my ears like the tolling of a bell</p>

<p id="id10297">The words of the wise fall
like the tolling of sweet, grave bells upon the soul</p>

<p id="id10298">The world had vanished like a phantasmagoria</p>

<p id="id10299">The world is bitter as a tear</p>

<p id="id10300">The world is in a simmer, like a sea</p>

<p id="id10301">The world wavers within its circle like a dream</p>

<p id="id10302">The years stretched before her like some vast blank page
out to receive the record of her toil</p>

<p id="id10303">The years vanished like a May snowdrift</p>

<p id="id10304">The yellow apples glowed like fire</p>

<p id="id10305">Their glances met like crossed swords</p>

<p id="id10306">Their joy like sunshine deep and broad falls on my heart</p>

<p id="id10307">Their minds rested upon the thought,
as chasing butterflies might rest together on a flower</p>

<p id="id10308">Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss</p>

<p id="id10309">Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting</p>

<p id="id10310">Then fall unheeded like the faded flower</p>

<p id="id10311">Then felt I like some watcher of the skies</p>

<p id="id10312">Then it swelled out to rich and glorious harmonies
like a full orchestra playing under the sea</p>

<p id="id10313">Then the lover sighing like furnace</p>

<p id="id10314">Theories sprouted in his mind like mushrooms</p>

<p id="id10315">There is an air about you like the air that folds a star</p>

<p id="id10316">There, like a bird, it sits and sings</p>

<p id="id10317">There seemed to brood in the air a quiet benevolence
of a Father watching His myriad children at play</p>

many fields had been pressed between giant's fingers and so had been left</p>

<p id="id10322">These eyes like stars have led me</p>

<p id="id10323">These final words snapped like a whip-lash</p>

<p id="id10324">These thoughts pierced me like thorns</p>

<p id="id10326">They are as white foam on the swept sands</p>

<p id="id10327">They are as white swans in the dusk, thy white hands</p>

<p id="id10328">They are painted sharp as death</p>

<p id="id10329">They broke into pieces and fell on the ground,
like a silvery, shimmering shower of hail</p>

<p id="id10330">They dropped like panthers</p>

<p id="id10331">They fly like spray</p>

<p id="id10332">They had hands like claws</p>

<p id="id10367">Thy beauty like a beast it bites</p>

<p id="id10368">Thy brown benignant eyes have sudden gleams of gladness and surprise,
like woodland brooks that cross a sunlit spot</p>

<p id="id10369">Thy carven columns must have grown by magic, like a dream in stone</p>

<p id="id10370">Thy favors are but like the wind that kisses everything it meets</p>

<p id="id10371">Thy heart is light as a leaf of a tree</p>

<p id="id10372">Thy name burns like a gray and flickering candle flame</p>

<p id="id10373">Thy name will be as honey on men's lips</p>

<p id="id10374">Till death like sleep might steal on me</p>

<p id="id10375">Till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven</p>

<p id="id10376">Time drops in decay, like a candle burnt out</p>

<p id="id10377">Time like a pulse shakes fierce</p>

<p id="id10378">To drag life on, which
like a heavy chain lengthens behind with many a link of pain</p>

<p id="id10379">To forsake as the trees drop their leaves in autumn</p>

<p id="id10380">Toys with smooth trifles like a child at play</p>

<p id="id10381">Transitory as clouds without substance</p>

<p id="id10382">Transparent like a shining sun</p>

<p id="id10383">Tree and shrub altered their values
and became transmuted to silver sentinels</p>

<p id="id10392">Under the willow-tree glimmered her face
like a foam-flake drifting over the sea</p>

<p id="id10393">Unheralded, like some tornado
loosed out of the brooding hills, it came to pass</p>

<p id="id10394">Unknown, like a seed in fallow ground, was the germ of a plan</p>

<p id="id10395">Unmoving as a tombstone</p>

<p id="id10396">Untameable as flies</p>

<p id="id10397">Unutterable things pressing on my soul
like a pent-up storm craving for outlet</p>

<p id="id10398">Upcast like foam of the effacing tide</p>

<p id="id10399">Uplifting the soul as on dovelike wings</p>

<p id="id10400">Uplifting their stony peaks around us
like the walls and turrets of a gigantic fortress</p>

<p id="id10401">Urgent as the seas</p>

<p id="id10404">Vague as a dream</p>

<p id="id10405">Vague thoughts that stream shapelessly through her mind
like long sad vapors through the twilight sky</p>

<p id="id10406">Vanish into thin air, like ghosts at the cockcrow</p>

<p id="id10407">Vanished like snow when comes a thaw</p>

<p id="id10408">Vanished like vapor before the sun</p>

<p id="id10409">Vibrations set quivering like harp strings struck by the hand of a master</p>

<p id="id10410">Vociferous praise following like a noisy wave</p>

<p id="id10412">Walking somewhat unsteadily like a blind man feeling his way</p>

<p id="id10413">Waves glittered and danced on all sides like millions of diamonds</p>

<p id="id10414">We left her and retraced our steps like faithless hounds</p>

<p id="id10415">Weak and frail like the vapor of a vale</p>

<p id="id10416">Wearing their wounds like stars</p>

<p id="id10417">Weary wind, who wanderest like the world's rejected guest</p>

<p id="id10418">When a draft might puff them out like a guttering candle<br>

</p>

<p id="id10419">When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,
like a pair of turtle-doves that could not live asunder day or night</p>

<p id="id10420">When cards, invitations, and three-corn'd notes
fly about like white butterflies</p>

<p id="id10421">When she died, her breath whistled like the wind in a keyhole</p>

<p id="id10422">When the fever pierced me like a knife</p>

<p id="id10423">Where a lamp of deathless beauty shines like a beacon</p>

<p id="id10424">Where heroes die as leaves fall</p>

<p id="id10425">Where the intricate wheels of trade are grinding on, like a mill</p>

<p id="id10426">Where the source of the waters is fine as a thread</p>

<p id="id10427">Whilst the lagging hours of the day went by
like windless clouds o'er a tender sky</p>

<p id="id10428">Whistled sharply in the air like a handful of vipers</p>

<p id="id10429">White as a ghost from darkness</p>

<p id="id10430">White as chalk</p>

<p id="id10431">White as dove or lily, or spirit of the light</p>

<p id="id10434">White as the sea-bird's wing</p>

<p id="id10435">White clouds like daisies</p>

<p id="id10436">White hands she moves like swimming swans</p>

<p id="id10437">White hands through her hair,
like white doves going into the shadow of a wood</p>

<p id="id10438">White like flame</p>

<p id="id10439">White sails of sloops like specters</p>

<p id="id10440">Whose bodies are as strong as alabaster</p>

<p id="id10441">Whose hair was as gold raiment on a king</p>

<p id="id10442">Whose laugh moves like a bat through silent haunted woods</p>

<p id="id10444">Whose music like a robe of living light reclothed each new-born age</p>

<p id="id10445">Windy speech which hits all around the mark like a drunken carpenter</p>

<p id="id10446">Winged like an arrow to its mark</p>

<p id="id10447">With a sting like a scorpion</p>

<p id="id10448">With all the complacency of a homeless cat</p>

<p id="id10475">Your charms lay like metals in a mine</p>

<p id="id10476">Your eyes are like fantastic moons that shiver in some stagnant lake</p>

<p id="id10477">Your eyes as blue as violets</p>

<p id="id10478">Your eyes they were green and gray like an April day</p>

<p id="id10479">Your frail fancies are swallowed up,
like chance flowers flung upon the river's current</p>

<p id="id10480">Your hair was golden as tints of sunrise</p>

<p id="id10481">Your heart is as dry as a reed</p>

<h3 id="id10489" style="margin-top: 3em">SECTION IX</h3>

<h5 id="id10490">CONVERSATIONAL PHRASES</h5>

<h4 id="id10491" style="margin-top: 2em">A</h4>

<p id="id10492">A most extraordinary idea!</p>

<p id="id10493">A thousand hopes for your success</p>

<p id="id10494">Accept my best wishes</p>

<p id="id10495">All that is conjecture</p>

<p id="id10496">Allow me to congratulate you</p>

<p id="id10497">An unfortunate comparison, don't you think?</p>

<p id="id10498">And even if it were so?</p>

<p id="id10499">And how am I to thank you?</p>

<p id="id10500">And in the end, what are you going to make of it?</p>

<p id="id10501">And yet the explanation does not wholly satisfy me</p>

<p id="id10502">Apparently I was wrong</p>

<p id="id10503">Are we wandering from the point?</p>

<p id="id10504">Are you a trifle—bored?</p>

<p id="id10505">Are you fully reconciled?</p>

<p id="id10506">Are you not complicating the question?</p>

<p id="id10507">Are you prepared to go to that length?</p>

<p id="id10508" style="margin-right: 0%; margin-left: 0%">Are you still obdurate?
           [obdurate = Hardened in wrongdoing; stubbornly impenitent]</p>

<p id="id10509">As it happens, your conjecture is right</p>

<p id="id10510">Assuredly I do</p>

<p id="id10511">At first blush it may seem fantastic</p>

<h4 id="id10512" style="margin-top: 2em">B</h4>

<p id="id10513">Banish such thoughts</p>

<p id="id10514">But are you not taking a slightly one-sided point of view?</p>

<p id="id10515">But consider for a moment</p>

<p id="id10516">But I look at the practical side</p>

<p id="id10517">But I wander from my point</p>

<p id="id10518">But now I'll confide something to you</p>

<p id="id10519">But perhaps I'm hardly fair when I say that</p>

<p id="id10520">But seriously speaking, what is the use of it?</p>

<p id="id10521">But surely that is inconsistent</p>

<p id="id10522">But that's a tremendous hazard</p>

<p id="id10523">But the thing is simply impossible</p>

<p id="id10524">But there's one thing you haven't said</p>

<p id="id10525">But, wait, you haven't heard the end</p>

<p id="id10526">But what do you yourself think about it?</p>

<p id="id10527">But who could foresee what was going to happen?</p>

<p id="id10528">But you are open to persuasion?</p>

<p id="id10529">But you do not know for certain</p>

<p id="id10530">But you must tell me more</p>

<p id="id10531">By a curious chance, I know it very well</p>

<p id="id10532">By no means desirable, I think</p>

<h4 id="id10533" style="margin-top: 2em">C</h4>

<p id="id10534">Can I persuade you?</p>

<p id="id10535">Can you imagine anything so horrible?</p>

<p id="id10536">Certain circumstances make it undesirable</p>

<p id="id10537">Certainly not, if it displeases you</p>

<p id="id10538">Certainly, with the greatest pleasure</p>

<p id="id10539">Come, where's your sense of humor?</p>

<p id="id10540">Consult me when you want me—at any time</p>

<h4 id="id10541" style="margin-top: 2em">D</h4>

<p id="id10542">Decidedly so</p>

<p id="id10543">Dine with me to-morrow night?—if you are free?</p>

<p id="id10544">Do I presume too much?</p>

<p id="id10545">Do I seem very ungenerous?</p>

<p id="id10546">Do not misunderstand me</p>

<p id="id10547">Do not the circumstances justify it?</p>

<p id="id10548">Don't be so dismal, please</p>

<p id="id10549">Don't delude yourself</p>

<p id="id10550">Don't let me encroach on your good nature</p>

<p id="id10551">Don't think I am unappreciative of your kindness</p>

<p id="id10552">Do you attach any particular meaning to that?</p>

<p id="id10553">Do you know, I envy you that</p>

<p id="id10554">Do you know what his chief interests are now?</p>

<p id="id10555">Do you mind my making a suggestion?</p>

<p id="id10556">Do you press me to tell?</p>

<p id="id10557">Do you really regard him as a serious antagonist?</p>

<p id="id10558">Do you think there is anything ominous in it?</p>

<p id="id10559">Does it please you so tremendously?</p>

<p id="id10560">Does it seem incredible?</p>

<h4 id="id10561" style="margin-top: 2em">E</h4>

<p id="id10562">Either way is perplexing</p>

<p id="id10563">Eminently proper, I think</p>

<p id="id10564">Everyone looks at it differently</p>

<p id="id10565">Excuse my bluntness</p>

<h4 id="id10566" style="margin-top: 2em">F</h4>

<p id="id10567">Fanciful, I should say</p>

<p id="id10568">For the simplest of reasons</p>

<p id="id10569">Forgive me if I seem disobliging</p>

<p id="id10570">Fortunate, to say the least</p>

<p id="id10571">Frankly, I don't see why it should</p>

<p id="id10572">Frugal to a degree</p>

<p id="id10573">Fulsome praise, I call it</p>

<h4 id="id10574" style="margin-top: 2em">G</h4>

<p id="id10575">Give me your sympathy and counsel</p>

<p id="id10576">Glorious to contemplate</p>

<p id="id10577">Good! that is at least something</p>

<p id="id10578">Gratifying, I am sure</p>

<h4 id="id10579" style="margin-top: 2em">H</h4>

<p id="id10580">Happily there are exceptions to every rule</p>

<p id="id10581">Has it really come to that?</p>

<p id="id10582">Have I incurred your displeasure?</p>

<p id="id10583">Have you any rooted objection to it?</p>

<p id="id10584">Have you anything definite in your mind?</p>

<p id="id10585">Have you reflected what the consequences might be to yourself?</p>

<p id="id10586">He does me too much honor</p>

<p id="id10587">He feels it acutely</p>

<p id="id10588">He has a queer conception of the proprieties</p>

<p id="id10589">He is a poor dissembler   [dissemble = conceal behind a false appearance]</p>

<p id="id10590">He is anything but obtuse</p>

<p id="id10591">He is so ludicrously wrong</p>

<p id="id10592">He is the most guileless of men</p>

<p id="id10593">He was so extremely susceptible</p>

<p id="id10594">He writes uncommonly clever letters</p>

<p id="id10595">Heaven forbid that I should wound your sensibility</p>

<p id="id10596">His sense of humor is unquenchable</p>

<p id="id10597">How amiable you are to say so</p>

<p id="id10598">How can I tell you how much I have enjoyed it all?</p>

<p id="id10599">How can I thank you?</p>

<p id="id10600">How can you be so unjust?</p>

<p id="id10601">How delightful to meet you</p>

<p id="id10602">How does the idea appeal to you?</p>

<p id="id10603">How droll you are!</p>

<p id="id10604">How extraordinary!</p>

<p id="id10605">How intensely interesting!</p>

<p id="id10606">How perfectly delightful!</p>

<p id="id10607">How utterly abominable</p>

<p id="id10608">How very agreeable this is!</p>

<p id="id10609">How very interesting</p>

<p id="id10610">How very surprising</p>

<p id="id10611">How well you do it!</p>

<p id="id10612">However, I should like to hear your views</p>

<p id="id10613">Human nature interests me very much indeed</p>

<h4 id="id10614" style="margin-top: 2em">I</h4>

<p id="id10615">I admire your foresight</p>

<p id="id10616">I admit it most gratefully</p>

<p id="id10617">I agree—at least, I suppose I do</p>

<p id="id10618">I agree that something ought to be done</p>

<p id="id10619">I always welcome criticism so long as it is sincere</p>

<p id="id10620">I am absolutely bewildered</p>

<p id="id10621">I am afraid I am not familiar enough with the subject</p>

<p id="id10622">I am afraid I cannot suggest an alternative</p>

<p id="id10623">I am afraid I've allowed you to tire yourself</p>

<p id="id10624">I am afraid I must confess my ignorance</p>

<p id="id10625">I am afraid you will call me a sentimentalist</p>

<p id="id10626">I am always glad to do anything to please you</p>

<p id="id10627">I am anxious to discharge the very onerous debt I owe you</p>

<p id="id10628">I am appealing to your sense of humor</p>

<p id="id10629">I am at your service</p>

<p id="id10630">I am bound to secrecy</p>

<p id="id10631">I am compelled to, unluckily</p>

<p id="id10632">I am curious to learn what his motive was</p>

<p id="id10633">I am deeply flattered and grateful</p>

<p id="id10634">I am delighted to hear you say so</p>

<p id="id10635">I am dumb with admiration</p>

<p id="id10636">I am entirely at your disposal</p>

<p id="id10637">I am extremely glad you approve of it</p>

<p id="id10638">I am far from believing the maxim</p>

<p id="id10639">I am fortunate in being able to do you a service</p>

<p id="id10640">I am glad to be able to think that</p>

<p id="id10641">I am glad to have had this talk with you</p>

<p id="id10642">I am glad to say that I have entirely lost that faculty</p>

<p id="id10643">I am glad you can see it in that way</p>

<p id="id10644">I am glad you feel so deeply about it</p>

<p id="id10645">I am giving you well-deserved praise</p>

<p id="id10646">I am going to make a confession</p>

<p id="id10647">I am grateful for your good opinion</p>

<p id="id10648">I am honestly indignant</p>

<p id="id10649">I am, I confess, a little discouraged</p>

<p id="id10650">I am in a chastened mood</p>

<p id="id10651">I am inclined to agree with you</p>

<p id="id10652">I am incredulous</p>

<p id="id10653">I am indebted to you for the suggestion</p>

<p id="id10654">I am listening—I was about to propose</p>

<p id="id10655">I am lost in admiration</p>

<p id="id10656">I am luckily disengaged to-day</p>

<p id="id10657">I am more grieved than I can tell you</p>

<p id="id10658">I am naturally overjoyed</p>

<p id="id10659">I am not a person of prejudices</p>

<p id="id10660">I am not an alarmist</p>

<p id="id10661">I am not as unreasonable as you suppose</p>

<p id="id10662">I am not at all in the secret of his ambitions</p>

<p id="id10663">I am not capable of unraveling it</p>

<p id="id10664">I am not going into sordid details</p>

<p id="id10665">I am not going to let you evade the question</p>

<p id="id10666">I am not going to pay you any idle compliments</p>

<p id="id10667">I am not impervious to the obligations involved</p>

<p id="id10668">I am not in sympathy with it</p>

<p id="id10669">I am not in the least surprised</p>

<p id="id10670">I am not inquisitive</p>

<p id="id10671">I am not prepared to say</p>

<p id="id10672">I am not sure that I can manage it</p>

<p id="id10673">I am not vindictive</p>

<p id="id10674">I am overjoyed to hear you say so</p>

<p id="id10675">I am perfectly aware of what I am saying</p>

<p id="id10676">I am persuaded by your candor</p>

<p id="id10677">I am quite convinced of that</p>

<p id="id10678">I am quite discomfited</p>

<p id="id10679">I am quite interested to see what you will do</p>

<p id="id10680">I am quite ready to be convinced</p>

<p id="id10681">I am rather of the opinion that I was mistaken</p>

<p id="id10682">I am ready to make great allowances</p>

<p id="id10683">I am really afraid I don't know</p>

<p id="id10684">I am really gregarious</p>

<p id="id10685">I am sensible of the flattery</p>

<p id="id10686">I am seriously annoyed with myself about it</p>

<p id="id10687">I am so glad you think that</p>

<p id="id10688">I am so sorry—so very sorry</p>

<p id="id10689">I am sorry to disillusionize you</p>

<p id="id10690">I am sorry to interrupt this interesting discussion</p>

<p id="id10691">I am sorry to say it is impossible</p>

<p id="id10692">I am speaking plainly</p>

<p id="id10693">I am still a little of an idealist</p>

<p id="id10694">I am suppressing many of the details</p>

<p id="id10695">I am sure it sounds very strange to you</p>

<p id="id10696">I am sure you could pay me no higher compliment</p>

<p id="id10697">I am  sure you will hear me out</p>

<p id="id10698">I am surprised, I confess</p>

<p id="id10699">I am sustained by the prospect of a good dinner</p>

<p id="id10700">I am vastly obliged to you</p>

<p id="id10701">I am vastly your debtor for the information</p>

<p id="id10702">I am very far from being a fanatic</p>

<p id="id10703">I am very glad of this opportunity</p>

<p id="id10704">I am very grateful—very much flattered</p>

<p id="id10705">I am wholly in agreement with you</p>

<p id="id10706">I am willing to accept all the consequences</p>

<p id="id10707">I am wonderfully well</p>

<p id="id10708">I am wondering if I may dare ask you a very personal question?</p>

<p id="id10709">I am your creditor unawares</p>

<p id="id10710">I anticipate your argument</p>

<p id="id10711">I appreciate your motives</p>

<p id="id10712">I assure you it is most painful to me</p>

<p id="id10713">I assure you my knowledge of it is limited</p>

<p id="id10714">I bear no malice about that</p>

<p id="id10715">I beg your indulgence</p>

<p id="id10716">I beg your pardon, but you take it too seriously</p>

<p id="id10717">I brazenly confess it</p>

<p id="id10718">I can easily understand your astonishment</p>

<p id="id10719">I can explain the apparent contradiction</p>

<p id="id10720">I can find no satisfaction in it</p>

<p id="id10721">I can hardly agree with you there</p>

<p id="id10722">I can never be sufficiently grateful</p>

<p id="id10723">I can only tell you the bare facts</p>

<p id="id10724">I can scarcely accept the offer</p>

<p id="id10725">I can scarcely boast that honor</p>

<p id="id10726">I can scarcely imagine anything more disagreeable</p>

<p id="id10727">I can sympathize with you</p>

<p id="id10728">I cannot altogether acquit myself of interested motives</p>

<p id="id10729">I cannot explain it even to myself</p>

<p id="id10730">I cannot find much real satisfaction in it</p>

<p id="id10731">I cannot forbear to press my advantage</p>

<p id="id10732">I cannot imagine what you mean</p>

<p id="id10733">I cannot precisely determine</p>

<p id="id10734">I can't pretend to make a jest of what I'm going to say</p>

<p id="id10735">I cannot say definitely at the moment</p>

<p id="id10736">I cannot say that in fact it is always so</p>

<p id="id10737">I cannot see how you draw that conclusion</p>

<p id="id10738">I cannot thank you enough for all your consideration</p>

<p id="id10739">I compliment you on your good sense</p>

<p id="id10740">I confess, I find it difficult</p>

<p id="id10741">I could ask for nothing better</p>

<p id="id10742">I could never forgive myself for that</p>

<p id="id10743">I dare say your intuition is quite right</p>

<p id="id10744">I decline to commit myself beforehand</p>

<p id="id10745">I detest exaggeration</p>

<p id="id10746">I didn't mean that—exactly</p>

<p id="id10747">I do not comprehend your meaning</p>

<p id="id10748">I don't deny that it is interesting</p>

<p id="id10749">I don't doubt it for a moment</p>

<p id="id10750">I do not doubt the sincerity of your arguments</p>

<p id="id10751">I do not exactly understand you</p>

<p id="id10752">I do not feel sure that I entirely share your views</p>

<p id="id10753">I don't feel that it is my business</p>

<p id="id10754">I do not find it an unpleasant subject</p>

<p id="id10755">I don't insist on your believing me</p>

<p id="id10756">I don't justify my presumption</p>

<p id="id10757">I don't know quite why you should say that</p>

<p id="id10758">I don't know that I can do that</p>

<p id="id10759">I don't know when I have heard anything so lamentable</p>

<p id="id10760">I don't know why you should be displeased</p>

<p id="id10761">I don't make myself clear, I see</p>

<p id="id10762">I don't pretend to explain</p>

<p id="id10763">I don't see anything particularly wonderful in it</p>

<p id="id10764">I don't underrate his kindness</p>

<p id="id10765">I don't want to disguise that from you</p>

<p id="id10766">I don't want to exaggerate</p>

<p id="id10767">I don't want to seem critical</p>

<p id="id10768">I doubt the truth of that saying</p>

<p id="id10769">I endorse it, every word</p>

<p id="id10770">I entirely approve of your plan</p>

<p id="id10771">I fancy it's just that</p>

<p id="id10772">I fear I cannot help you</p>

<p id="id10773">I fear that's too technical for me</p>

<p id="id10774">I feel a certain apprehension</p>

<p id="id10775">I feel an unwonted sense of gaiety         [unwonted = unusual]</p>

<p id="id10776">I feel it my duty to be frank with you</p>

<p id="id10777">I feel myself scarcely competent to judge</p>

<p id="id10778">I feel very grateful to you for your kind offer</p>

<p id="id10779">I find it absorbing</p>

<p id="id10780">I find it rather monotonous</p>

<p id="id10781">I find this agreeable mental exhilaration</p>

<p id="id10782">I frankly confess that</p>

<p id="id10783">I generally trust my first impressions</p>

<p id="id10784">I give my word gladly</p>

<p id="id10785">I give you my most sacred word of honor</p>

<p id="id10786">I had better begin at the beginning</p>

<p id="id10787">I had no intention of being offensive</p>

<p id="id10788">I hadn't thought of it in that light</p>

<p id="id10789">I hardly think that could be so</p>

<p id="id10790">I have a hundred reasons for thinking so</p>

<p id="id10791">I have a peculiar affection for it</p>

<p id="id10792">I have an immense faith in him</p>

<p id="id10793">I have been constrained by circumstances</p>

<p id="id10794">I have been decidedly impressed</p>

<p id="id10795">I have been longing to see more of you</p>

<p id="id10796">I have been puzzling over a dilemma</p>

<p id="id10797">I have every reason to think so</p>

<p id="id10798">I have given you the best proof of it</p>

<p id="id10799">I have gone back to my first impressions</p>

<p id="id10800">I have known striking instances of the kind</p>

<p id="id10801">I have never heard it put so well</p>

<p id="id10802">I have no delusions on that score</p>

<p id="id10803">I have not succeeded in convincing myself of that</p>

<p id="id10804">I have not the influence you think</p>

<p id="id10805">I have not the least doubt of it</p>

<p id="id10806">I haven't the remotest idea</p>

<p id="id10807">I have often a difficulty in deciding</p>

<p id="id10808">I have often marveled at your courage</p>

<p id="id10809">I have quite changed my opinion about that</p>

<p id="id10810">I have something of great importance to say to you</p>

<p id="id10811">I have sometimes vaguely felt it</p>

<p id="id10812">I have the strongest possible prejudice against it</p>

<p id="id10813">I heartily congratulate you</p>

<p id="id10814">I hope it will not seem unreasonable to you</p>

<p id="id10815">I hope we may meet again</p>

<p id="id10816">I hope you will forgive an intruder</p>

<p id="id10817">I hope you will not think me irreverent</p>

<p id="id10818">I hope you will pardon my seeming carelessness</p>

<p id="id10819">I indulge the modest hope</p>

<p id="id10820">I know it is very presumptuous</p>

<p id="id10821">I know my request will appear singular</p>

<p id="id10822">I like it immensely</p>

<p id="id10823">I like your frankness</p>

<p id="id10824">I make no reflection whatever</p>

<p id="id10825">I mean it literally</p>

<p id="id10826">I might question all that</p>

<p id="id10827">I mistrust these wild impulses</p>

<p id="id10828">I most certainly agree with you</p>

<p id="id10829">I most humbly ask pardon</p>

<p id="id10830">I must add my congratulations on your taste</p>

<p id="id10831">I must apologize for intruding upon you</p>

<p id="id10832">I must ask you one more question, if I may</p>

<p id="id10833">I must confess I have never thought of that</p>

<p id="id10834">I must refrain from any comment</p>

<p id="id10835">I must respectfully decline to tell you</p>

<p id="id10836">I must take this opportunity to tell you</p>

<p id="id10837">I need not remind you that you have a grave responsibility</p>

<p id="id10838">I never heard anything so absurd</p>

<p id="id10839">I offer my humblest apologies</p>

<p id="id10840">I owe the idea wholly to you</p>

<p id="id10841">I partly agree with you</p>

<p id="id10842">I personally owe you a great debt of thankfulness</p>

<p id="id10843">I place myself entirely at your service</p>

<p id="id10844">I place the most implicit reliance on your good sense</p>

<p id="id10845">I prefer to reserve my judgment</p>

<p id="id10846">I purposely evaded the question</p>

<p id="id10847">I quite appreciate the very clever way you put it</p>

<p id="id10848">I quite see what the advantages are</p>

<p id="id10849">I really am curious to know how you guessed that</p>

<p id="id10850">I realize how painful it must be to you</p>

<p id="id10851">I recollect it clearly</p>

<p id="id10852">I rely on your good sense</p>

<p id="id10853">I remember the occasion perfectly</p>

<p id="id10854">I resent that kind of thing</p>

<p id="id10855">I respect you for that</p>

<p id="id10856">I respect your critical faculty</p>

<p id="id10857">I say it in all modesty</p>

<p id="id10858">I see disapproval in your face</p>

<p id="id10859">I see it from a different angle</p>

<p id="id10860">I see you are an enthusiast</p>

<p id="id10861">I see your point of view</p>

<p id="id10862">I seem to have heard that sentiment before</p>

<p id="id10863">I shall at once proceed to forget it</p>

<p id="id10864">I shall await your pleasure</p>

<p id="id10865">I shall be glad if you will join me</p>

<p id="id10866">I shall be interested to watch it develop</p>

<p id="id10867">I shall be most proud and pleased</p>

<p id="id10868">I shall certainly take you at your word</p>

<p id="id10869">I shall feel highly honored</p>

<p id="id10870">I shall make a point of thinking so</p>

<p id="id10871">I shall never forget your kindness</p>

<p id="id10872">I shall respect your confidence</p>

<p id="id10873">I should appreciate your confidence greatly</p>

<p id="id10874">I should be very ungrateful were I not satisfied with it</p>

<p id="id10875">I should feel unhappy if I did otherwise</p>

<p id="id10876">I should like your opinion of it</p>

<p id="id10877">I should not dream of asking you to do so</p>

<p id="id10878">I should think it very unlikely</p>

<p id="id10879">I simply cannot endure it</p>

<p id="id10880">I spoke only in jest</p>

<p id="id10881">I stand corrected</p>

<p id="id10882">I suppose I ought to feel flattered</p>

<p id="id10883">I surmised as much</p>

<p id="id10884">I sympathize deeply with you</p>

<p id="id10885">I take that for granted</p>

<p id="id10886">I think extremely well of it</p>

<p id="id10887">I think he has very noble ideals</p>

<p id="id10888">I think I can answer that for you</p>

<p id="id10889">I think I know what you are going to say</p>

<p id="id10890">I think it has its charm</p>

<p id="id10891">I think it is superb!</p>

<p id="id10892">I think it quite admirable</p>

<p id="id10893">I think its tone is remarkably temperate</p>

<p id="id10894">I think that is rather a brilliant idea</p>

<p id="id10895">I think what you say is reasonable</p>

<p id="id10896">I think you are quibbling</p>

<p id="id10897">I think you are rather severe in your opinions</p>

<p id="id10898">I think you have great appreciation of values</p>

<p id="id10899">I think you have summed it up perfectly</p>

<p id="id10900">I think your candor is charming</p>

<p id="id10901">I thoroughly agree with you</p>

<p id="id10902">I thought it most amusing</p>

<p id="id10903">I thought you were seriously indisposed</p>

<p id="id10904">I trust you will not consider it an impertinence</p>

<p id="id10905">I understand exactly how you feel about it</p>

<p id="id10906">I understand your delicacy of feeling</p>

<p id="id10907">I venture to propose another plan</p>

<p id="id10908">I very rarely allow myself that pleasure</p>

<p id="id10909">I want to have a frank understanding with you</p>

<p id="id10910">I was at a loss to understand the reason for it</p>

<p id="id10911">I was hoping that I could persuade you</p>

<p id="id10912">I was on the point of asking you</p>

<p id="id10913">I was speaking generally</p>

<p id="id10914">I watched you with admiration</p>

<p id="id10915">I will answer you frankly</p>

<p id="id10916">I will listen to no protestations</p>

<p id="id10917">I will take it only under compulsion</p>

<p id="id10918">I will tell you what puzzles me</p>

<p id="id10919">I will think of it, since you wish it</p>

<p id="id10920">I will, with great pleasure</p>

<p id="id10921">I wish I could explain my point more fully</p>

<p id="id10922">I wish I knew what you meant by that</p>

<p id="id10923">I wish to be perfectly fair</p>

<p id="id10924">I wish to put things as plainly as possible</p>

<p id="id10925">I wonder how much truth there is in it?</p>

<p id="id10926">I wonder if you have the smallest recollection of me?</p>

<p id="id10927">I would agree if I understood</p>

<p id="id10928">I wouldn't put it just that way</p>

<p id="id10929">If ever I can repay it, command me</p>

<p id="id10930">If I mistake not you were there once?</p>

<p id="id10931">If I speak strongly, it is because I feel strongly</p>

<p id="id10932">If I were disposed to offer counsel</p>

<p id="id10933">If I were sure you would not misunderstand my meaning</p>

<p id="id10934">If you don't mind my saying so</p>

<p id="id10935">If you insist upon it</p>

<p id="id10936">If you will pardon me the frankness</p>

<p id="id10937">In a manner that sometimes terrifies me</p>

<p id="id10938">In one respect you are quite right</p>

<p id="id10939">In that case let me rob you of a few minutes</p>

<p id="id10940">In what case, for example?</p>

<p id="id10941">Incredible as it sounds, I had for a moment forgotten</p>

<p id="id10942">Indeed, but it is quite possible</p>

<p id="id10943">Indeed! How?</p>

<p id="id10944">Indeed, you are wholly wrong</p>

<p id="id10945">Indifferently so, I am afraid</p>

<p id="id10946">Irony was ten thousand leagues from my intention</p>

<p id="id10947">Is it sane—is it reasonable?</p>

<p id="id10948">Isn't it amazing?</p>

<p id="id10949">Isn't it extraordinarily funny?</p>

<p id="id10950">Isn't it preposterous?</p>

<p id="id10951">Isn't that a trifle unreasonable?</p>

<p id="id10952">Isn't that rather a hasty conclusion?</p>

<p id="id10953">Is that a fair question?</p>

<p id="id10954">It always seemed to me impossible</p>

<p id="id10955">It amuses you, doesn't it?</p>

<p id="id10956">It blunts the sensibilities</p>

<p id="id10957">It could never conceivably be anything but popular</p>

<p id="id10958">It depends on how you look at it</p>

<p id="id10959">It depends upon circumstances</p>

<p id="id10960">It doesn't sound plausible to me</p>

<p id="id10961">It has a lovely situation as I remember it</p>

<p id="id10962">It has amused me hugely</p>

<p id="id10963">It has been a relief to talk to you</p>

<p id="id10964">It has been an immense privilege to see you</p>

<p id="id10965">It has never occurred to me</p>

<p id="id10966">It is a curious fact</p>

<p id="id10967">It is a great pleasure to meet you</p>

<p id="id10968">It is a huge undertaking</p>

<p id="id10969">It is a most unfortunate affair</p>

<p id="id10970">It is a perfectly plain proposition</p>

<p id="id10971">It is a rather melancholy thought</p>

<p id="id10972">It is a truth universally acknowledged</p>

<p id="id10973">It is all very inexcusable</p>

<p id="id10974">It is all very well for you to be philosophical</p>

<p id="id10975">It is altogether probable</p>

<p id="id10976">It is an admirable way of putting it</p>

<p id="id10977">It is an error of taste</p>

<p id="id10978">It is an extreme case, but the principle is sound</p>

<p id="id10979">It is an ingenious theory</p>

<p id="id10980">It is an uncommonly fine description</p>

<p id="id10981">It is extremely interesting, I can assure you</p>

<p id="id10982">It is for you to decide</p>

<p id="id10983">It is historically true</p>

<p id="id10984">It is I who should ask forgiveness</p>

<p id="id10985">It is incredible!</p>

<p id="id10986">It is indeed generous of you to suggest it</p>

<p id="id10987">It is inexplicable</p>

<p id="id10988">It is interesting, as a theory</p>

<p id="id10989">It is literally impossible</p>

<p id="id10990">It is merely a mood</p>

<p id="id10991">It is most unfortunate</p>

<p id="id10992">It is my deliberately formed opinion</p>

<p id="id10993">It is my opinion you are too conscientious</p>

<p id="id10994">It is nevertheless true</p>

<p id="id10995">It is not a matter of the slightest consequence</p>

<p id="id10996">It is not always fair to judge by appearances</p>

<p id="id10997">It is not so unreasonable as you think</p>

<p id="id10998">It is often very misleading</p>

<p id="id10999">It is one of the grave problems of the day</p>

<p id="id11000">It is only a fancy of mine</p>

<p id="id11001">It is perfectly defensible</p>

<p id="id11002">It is perfectly trite</p>

<p id="id11003">It is permissible to gratify such an impulse</p>

<p id="id11004">It is possible, but I rather doubt it</p>

<p id="id11005">It is quite an easy matter</p>

<p id="id11006">It is quite conceivable</p>

<p id="id11007">It is quite too absurd</p>

<p id="id11008">It is rather startling</p>

<p id="id11009">It is really impressive</p>

<p id="id11010">It is really most callous of you to laugh</p>

<p id="id11011">It is sheer madness</p>

<p id="id11012">It is sickening and so insufferably arrogant</p>

<p id="id11013">It is simply a coincidence</p>

<p id="id11014">It is the most incomprehensible thing in the world</p>

<p id="id11015">It is to you that I am indebted for all this</p>

<p id="id11016">It is true, I am grieved to say</p>

<p id="id11017">It is true none the less</p>

<p id="id11018">It is very amusing</p>

<p id="id11019">It is very far from being a fiction</p>

<p id="id11020">It is very good of you to do this for my pleasure</p>

<p id="id11021">It is very ingenious</p>

<p id="id11022">It is very splendid of you</p>

<p id="id11023">It is wanton capriciousness</p>

<p id="id11024">It is your privilege to think so</p>

<p id="id11025">It's a difficult and delicate matter to discuss</p>

<p id="id11026">It's a matter of immediate urgency</p>

<p id="id11027">It's absolute folly</p>

<p id="id11028">It's absurd—it's impossible</p>

<p id="id11029">It's all nonsense</p>

<p id="id11030">It's as logical as it can be under the circumstances</p>

<p id="id11031">It's been a strange experience for you</p>

<p id="id11032">It's deliciously honest</p>

<p id="id11033">It's going to be rather troublesome</p>

<p id="id11034">It's inconceivable that it should ever be necessary</p>

<p id="id11035">It's mere pride of opinion</p>

<p id="id11036">It's my chief form of recreation</p>

<p id="id11037">It's not a matter of vast importance</p>

<p id="id11038">It's past my comprehension</p>

<p id="id11039">It's quite wonderful how logical and simple you make it</p>

<p id="id11040">It's really very perplexing</p>

<p id="id11041">It's so charming of you to say that</p>

<p id="id11042">It's so kind of you to come</p>

<p id="id11043">It's such a bore having to talk about it</p>

<p id="id11044">It's the natural sequence</p>

<p id="id11045">It's too melancholy</p>

<p id="id11046">It's very wonderful</p>

<p id="id11047">It makes it all quite interesting</p>

<p id="id11048">It may sound strange to you</p>

<p id="id11049">It must be a trifle dull at times</p>

<p id="id11050">It must be fascinating</p>

<p id="id11051">It must be very gratifying to you</p>

<p id="id11052">It must have been rather embarrassing</p>

<p id="id11053">It seems an age since we've last seen you</p>

<p id="id11054">It seems entirely wonderful to me</p>

<p id="id11055">It seems incredible</p>

<p id="id11056">It seems like a distracting dream</p>

<p id="id11057">It seems preposterous</p>

<p id="id11058">It seems the height of absurdity</p>

<p id="id11059">It seems to me that you have a perfect right to do so</p>

<p id="id11060">It seems unspeakably funny to me</p>

<p id="id11061">It seems very ridiculous</p>

<p id="id11062">It shall be as you wish</p>

<p id="id11063">It should not be objectionable</p>

<p id="id11064">It sounds plausible</p>

<p id="id11065">It sounds profoundly interesting</p>

<p id="id11066">It sounds rather appalling</p>

<p id="id11067">It sounds very alluring</p>

<p id="id11068">It strikes me as rather pathetic</p>

<p id="id11069">It was an unpardonable liberty</p>

<p id="id11070">It was inevitable that you should say that</p>

<p id="id11071">It was most stupid of me to have forgotten it</p>

<p id="id11072">It was not unkindly meant</p>

<p id="id11073">It was peculiarly unfortunate</p>

<p id="id11074">It was really an extraordinary experience</p>

<p id="id11075">It was so incredible</p>

<p id="id11076">It was the most amazing thing I ever heard</p>

<p id="id11077">It was very good of you to come out and join us</p>

<p id="id11078">It will create a considerable sensation</p>

<p id="id11079">It will divert your thoughts from a mournful subject</p>

<p id="id11080">It will give me pleasure to do it</p>

<p id="id11081">It will not alter my determination</p>

<p id="id11082">It would be ill-advised</p>

<p id="id11083">It would interest me very much</p>

<p id="id11084">It would seem to be a wise decision</p>

<p id="id11085">It would take too long to formulate my thought</p>

<h4 id="id11086" style="margin-top: 2em">J</h4>

<p id="id11087">Join us, please, when you have time</p>

<p id="id11088">Just trust to the inspiration of the moment</p>

<p id="id11089">Justify it if you can</p>

<h4 id="id11090" style="margin-top: 2em">L</h4>

<p id="id11091">Let me persuade you</p>

<p id="id11092">Let me say how deeply indebted I feel for your kindness</p>

<p id="id11093">Let me speak frankly</p>

<p id="id11094">Let us grant that for the sake of the argument</p>

<p id="id11095">Let us take a concrete instance</p>

<h4 id="id11096" style="margin-top: 2em">M</h4>

<p id="id11097">Many thanks—how kind and good you are!</p>

<p id="id11098">May I ask to whom you allude?</p>

<p id="id11099">May I be privileged to hear it?</p>

<p id="id11100">May I speak freely?</p>

<p id="id11101">May I venture to ask what inference you would draw from that?</p>

<p id="id11102">Might I suggest an alternative?</p>

<p id="id11103">Most dangerous!</p>

<p id="id11104">My attitude would be one of disapproval</p>

<p id="id11105">My confidence in you is absolute</p>

<p id="id11106">My idea of it is quite the reverse</p>

<p id="id11107">My information is rather scanty</p>

<p id="id11108">My meaning is quite the contrary</p>

<p id="id11109">My point of view is different, but I shall not insist upon it</p>

<p id="id11110">My views are altered in many respects</p>

<h4 id="id11111" style="margin-top: 2em">N</h4>

<p id="id11112">No, I am speaking seriously</p>

<p id="id11113">No, I don't understand it</p>

<p id="id11114">Not at all</p>

<p id="id11115">Not to my knowledge</p>

<p id="id11116">Nothing could be more delightful</p>

<p id="id11117">Now is it very plain to you?</p>

<p id="id11118">Now you are flippant</p>

<h4 id="id11119" style="margin-top: 2em">O</h4>

<p id="id11120">Obviously the matter is settled</p>

<p id="id11121">Of course, but that again isn't the point</p>

<p id="id11122">Of course I am delighted</p>

<p id="id11123">Of course I don't want to press you against your will</p>

<p id="id11124">Of course you will do what you think best</p>

<p id="id11125">Oh, certainly, if you wish it</p>

<p id="id11126">Oh, do not form an erroneous impression</p>

<p id="id11127">Oh, I appreciate that in you!</p>

<p id="id11128">Oh, that's mere quibbling</p>

<p id="id11129">Oh, that's splendid of you!</p>

<p id="id11130">Oh, that was a manner of speaking</p>

<p id="id11131">Oh, yes, I quite admit that</p>

<p id="id11132">Oh, yes, you may take that for granted</p>

<p id="id11133">Oh, you are very bitter</p>

<p id="id11134">Oh, you may be as scornful as you like</p>

<p id="id11135">On the contrary, I agree with you thoroughly</p>

<p id="id11136">On the face of it, it sounds reasonable</p>

<p id="id11137">One assumption you make I should like to contest</p>

<p id="id11138">One has no choice to endure it</p>

<p id="id11139">One must be indulgent under the circumstances</p>

<p id="id11140">One thing I beg of you</p>

<h4 id="id11141" style="margin-top: 2em">P</h4>

<p id="id11142">Pardon me, but I don't think so</p>

<p id="id11143">Pardon me, I meant something different</p>

<p id="id11144">Perhaps I am indiscreet</p>

<p id="id11145">Perhaps not in the strictest sense</p>

<p id="id11146">Perhaps you do not feel at liberty to do so</p>

<p id="id11147">Perhaps you think me ungrateful</p>

<p id="id11148">Personally I confess to an objection</p>

<p id="id11149">Please continue to be frank</p>

<p id="id11150">Please do not think I am asking out of mere curiosity</p>

<p id="id11151">Please forgive my thoughtlessness</p>

<p id="id11152">Please make yourself at home</p>

<p id="id11153">Pray don't apologize</p>

<p id="id11154">Pray forgive me for intruding on you so unceremoniously</p>

<p id="id11155">Pray go on!</p>

<p id="id11156">Precisely, that is just what I meant</p>

<p id="id11157">Put in that way it certainly sounds very well</p>

<h4 id="id11158" style="margin-top: 2em">Q</h4>

<p id="id11159">Question me, if you wish</p>

<p id="id11160">Quibbling, I call it</p>

<p id="id11161">Quite so</p>

<p id="id11162">Quite the wisest thing you can do</p>

<h4 id="id11163" style="margin-top: 2em">R</h4>

<p id="id11164">Rather loquacious, I think        [loquacious = very talkative]</p>

<p id="id11165">Reading between the lines</p>

<p id="id11166">Really? I should have thought otherwise</p>

<p id="id11167">Really—you must go?</p>

<p id="id11168">Reassure me, if you can</p>

<p id="id11169">Reflect upon the possible consequences</p>

<p id="id11170">Relatively speaking</p>

<p id="id11171">Reluctantly I admit it</p>

<p id="id11172">Reverting to another matter</p>

<h4 id="id11173" style="margin-top: 2em">S</h4>

<p id="id11174">Shall we have a compact?</p>

<p id="id11175">She has an extraordinary gift of conversation</p>

<p id="id11176">She is easily prejudiced</p>

<p id="id11177">She seems uncommonly appreciative</p>

<p id="id11178">She will be immensely surprised</p>

<p id="id11179">Show me that the two cases are analogous</p>

<p id="id11180">So far so good</p>

<p id="id11181">So I inferred</p>

<p id="id11182">So much the better for me</p>

<p id="id11183">So you observe the transformation?</p>

<p id="id11184">Something amuses you</p>

<p id="id11185">Sometimes the absurdity of it occurs to me</p>

<p id="id11186">Speaking with all due respect</p>

<p id="id11187">Still, you might make an exception</p>

<p id="id11188">Strangely it's true</p>

<p id="id11189">Such conduct seems to me unjustifiable</p>

<p id="id11190">Surely there can be no question about that</p>

<p id="id11191">Surely we can speak frankly</p>

<p id="id11192">Surely you sound too harsh a note</p>

<p id="id11193">Surely you would not countenance that</p>

<h4 id="id11194" style="margin-top: 2em">T</h4>

<p id="id11195">Tell me in what way you want me to help you</p>

<p id="id11196">Thank you for telling me that</p>

<p id="id11197">Thank you for your good intentions</p>

<p id="id11198">That, at least, you will agree to</p>

<p id="id11199">That depends on one's point of view</p>

<p id="id11200">That doesn't sound very logical</p>

<p id="id11201">That is a counsel of perfection</p>

<p id="id11202">That is a fair question, perhaps</p>

<p id="id11203">That is a question I have often proposed to myself</p>

<p id="id11204">That is a stroke of good fortune</p>

<p id="id11205">That is a superb piece of work</p>

<p id="id11206">That is a very practical explanation</p>

<p id="id11207">That is admirably clear</p>

<p id="id11208">That is certainly ideal</p>

<p id="id11209">That is eminently proper</p>

<p id="id11210">That is hardly consistent</p>

<p id="id11211">That is inconceivable</p>

<p id="id11212">That is just like you, if you will forgive me for saying so</p>

<p id="id11213">That is most fortunate</p>

<p id="id11214">That is most kind of you</p>

<p id="id11215">That is most unexpected and distressing</p>

<p id="id11216">That is not fair—to me</p>

<p id="id11217">That is not to be lightly spoken of</p>

<p id="id11218">That is precisely what I mean</p>

<p id="id11219">That is quite true, theoretically</p>

<p id="id11220">That is rather a difficult question to answer</p>

<p id="id11221">That is rather a strange request to make</p>

<p id="id11222">That is rather awkward</p>

<p id="id11223">That is really good of you</p>

<p id="id11224">That is the prevailing idea</p>

<p id="id11225">That is tragic</p>

<p id="id11226">That is true and I think you are right</p>

<p id="id11227">That is very amiable in you</p>

<p id="id11228">That is very curious</p>

<p id="id11229">That is very felicitous</p>

<p id="id11230">That is very gracious</p>

<p id="id11231">That is what I call intelligent criticism</p>

<p id="id11232">That is what I meant to tell you</p>

<p id="id11233">That is a humiliating thought</p>

<p id="id11234">That is a most interesting idea</p>

<p id="id11235">That is such a hideous idea</p>

<p id="id11236">That is the most incredible part of it</p>

<p id="id11237">That might involve you in life-long self-reproach</p>

<p id="id11238">That must be exceedingly tiresome</p>

<p id="id11239">That ought to make you a little lenient</p>

<p id="id11240">That reassures me</p>

<p id="id11241">That shows the infirmity of his judgment</p>

<p id="id11242">That theory isn't tenable</p>

<p id="id11243">That was exceedingly generous</p>

<p id="id11244">That was intended ironically</p>

<p id="id11245">That was very thoughtful of you</p>

<p id="id11246">That was very well reasoned</p>

<p id="id11247">That will blast your chances, I am afraid</p>

<p id="id11248">That will suit me excellently</p>

<p id="id11249">That would be somewhat serious</p>

<p id="id11250">That would be very discreditable</p>

<p id="id11251">The agreement seems to be ideal</p>

<p id="id11252">The idea is monstrous</p>

<p id="id11253">The inference is obvious</p>

<p id="id11254">The notion is rather new to me</p>

<p id="id11255">The pleasure is certainly not all on your side</p>

<p id="id11256">The reason is not so far to seek</p>

<p id="id11257">The same problem has perplexed me</p>

<p id="id11258">The sentiment is worthy of you</p>

<p id="id11259">The simplest thing in the world</p>

<p id="id11260">The situation is uncommonly delicate</p>

<p id="id11261">The story seems to me incredible</p>

<p id="id11262">The subject is extremely interesting</p>

<p id="id11263">The tone of it was certainly hostile</p>

<p id="id11264">The very obvious moral is this</p>

<p id="id11265">The whole thing is an idle fancy</p>

<p id="id11266">Then I have your permission?</p>

<p id="id11267">Then you're really not disinclined?</p>

<p id="id11268">Then you merely want to ask my advice?</p>

<p id="id11269">There are endless difficulties</p>

<p id="id11270">There are reasons which make such a course impossible</p>

<p id="id11271">There is a good deal of sense in that</p>

<p id="id11272">There is a grain of truth in that, I admit</p>

<p id="id11273">There is food for reflection in that</p>

<p id="id11274">There is my hand on it</p>

<p id="id11275">There is no resisting you</p>

<p id="id11276">There is nothing I should like so much</p>

<p id="id11277">There is one inevitable condition</p>

<p id="id11278">There is something almost terrifying about it</p>

<p id="id11279">There must be extenuating circumstances</p>

<p id="id11280">They amuse me immensely</p>

<p id="id11281">This is a most unexpected pleasure</p>

<p id="id11282">This is charmingly new to me</p>

<p id="id11283">This is indeed good fortune</p>

<p id="id11284">This is really appalling</p>

<p id="id11285">This is really not a laughing matter</p>

<p id="id11286">Those are my own private feelings</p>

<p id="id11287">Those things are not forgotten at once</p>

<p id="id11288">To me it's simply outrageous</p>

<p id="id11289">To speak frankly, I do not like it</p>

<p id="id11290">True, I forgot!</p>

<h4 id="id11291" style="margin-top: 2em">U</h4>

<p id="id11292">Undeniably true</p>

<p id="id11293">Unfortunately I must decline the proposal</p>

<p id="id11294">Unlikely to be so</p>

<p id="id11295">Unquestionably superior</p>

<p id="id11296">Unwholesome influence, I would say</p>

<h4 id="id11297" style="margin-top: 2em">V</h4>

<p id="id11298">Very good, I'll do so</p>

<p id="id11299">Very well, I will consent</p>

<p id="id11300">Vivacity is her greatest charm</p>

<p id="id11301">Virtually accomplished, I believe</p>

<p id="id11302">Vouch for its truth</p>

<h4 id="id11303" style="margin-top: 2em">W</h4>

<p id="id11304">We are all more or less susceptible</p>

<p id="id11305">We are drifting away from our point</p>

<p id="id11306">We are impervious to certain rules</p>

<p id="id11307">We are merely wasting energy in this duel</p>

<p id="id11308">We can safely take it for granted</p>

<p id="id11309">We couldn't have a better topic</p>

<p id="id11310">We had better agree to differ</p>

<p id="id11311">We have had some conclusions in common</p>

<p id="id11312">We must judge it leniently</p>

<p id="id11313">We must not expose ourselves to misinterpretation</p>

<p id="id11314">We owe you a debt of gratitude</p>

<p id="id11315">We shall be glad to see you, if you care to come</p>

<p id="id11316">We will devoutly hope not</p>

<p id="id11317">Well, as a matter of fact, I have forgotten</p>

<p id="id11318">Well done! I congratulate you</p>

<p id="id11319">Well, I'm not going to argue that</p>

<p id="id11320">Well, I call it scandalous</p>

<p id="id11321">Well, I confess they don't appeal to me</p>

<p id="id11322">Well, more's the pity</p>

<p id="id11323">Well, perhaps it is none of my affair</p>

<p id="id11324">Well, that is certainly ideal!</p>

<p id="id11325">Well, this is good fortune</p>

<p id="id11326">Well, yes—in a way</p>

<p id="id11327">Well, you are a dreamer!</p>

<p id="id11328">What a beautiful idea</p>

<p id="id11329">What a charming place you have here</p>

<p id="id11330">What a curious coincidence!</p>

<p id="id11331">What a pretty compliment!</p>

<p id="id11332">What a tempting prospect!</p>

<p id="id11333">What an extraordinary idea!</p>

<p id="id11334">What are your misgivings?</p>

<p id="id11335">What can you possibly mean?</p>

<p id="id11336">What conceivable reason is there for it?</p>

<p id="id11337">What do you imagine my course should be?</p>

<p id="id11338">What do you propose?</p>

<p id="id11339">What is the next step in your argument?</p>

<p id="id11340">What is there so strange about that?</p>

<p id="id11341">What, may I ask, is your immediate object?</p>

<p id="id11342">What unseemly levity on his part</p>

<p id="id11343">What very kind things you say to me</p>

<p id="id11344">What would you expect me to do?</p>

<p id="id11345">What you have just said is even truer than you realize</p>

<p id="id11346">What you propose is utterly impossible</p>

<p id="id11347">Who is your sagacious adviser?       [sagacious = sound judgment, wise]</p>

<p id="id11348">Why ask such embarrassing questions?</p>

<p id="id11349">Why did you desert us so entirely?</p>

<p id="id11350">Why do you take it so seriously?</p>

<p id="id11351">Will you allow me to ask you a question?</p>

<p id="id11352">Will you be more explicit?</p>

<p id="id11353">Will you have the kindness to explain?</p>

<p id="id11354">Will you pardon my curiosity?</p>

<p id="id11355">Will you permit me a brief explanation?</p>

<p id="id11356">Would you apply that to everyone?</p>

<p id="id11357">Would you mind telling me your opinion?</p>

<h4 id="id11358" style="margin-top: 2em">Y</h4>

<p id="id11359">Yes and no</p>

<p id="id11360">Yes, but that is just what I fail to comprehend</p>

<p id="id11361">Yes, I dare say</p>

<p id="id11362">Yes, if you will be so good</p>

<p id="id11363">Yes, it was extraordinarily fine</p>

<p id="id11364">Yes, that is my earnest wish</p>

<p id="id11365">Yes, that's undeniable</p>

<p id="id11366">Yes? You were saying?</p>

<p id="id11367">You agree with me, I know</p>

<p id="id11368">You are a profound philosopher</p>

<p id="id11369">You are a severe critic</p>

<p id="id11370">You are delightfully frank</p>

<p id="id11371">You are greatly to be envied</p>

<p id="id11372">You are heartily welcome</p>

<p id="id11373">You are incomprehensible</p>

<p id="id11374">You are incorrigible</p>

<p id="id11375">You are kind and comforting</p>

<p id="id11376">You are most kind</p>

<p id="id11377">You are not consistent</p>

<p id="id11378">You are not serious, I hope</p>

<p id="id11379">You are not seriously displeased with me?</p>

<p id="id11380">You are quite delightful</p>

<p id="id11381">You are rather puzzling to-day</p>

<p id="id11382">You are right to remind me of that</p>

<p id="id11383">You are unduly distressing yourself</p>

<p id="id11384">You are very complimentary</p>

<p id="id11385">You are very gracious</p>

<p id="id11386">You're so tremendously kind about it</p>

<p id="id11387">You're succeeding admirably</p>

<p id="id11388">You're taking it all much too seriously</p>

<p id="id11389">You're talking nonsense!</p>

<p id="id11390">You're very good, I'm sure</p>

<p id="id11391">You ask me—but I shouldn't wonder if you knew better than I do</p>

<p id="id11392">You astonish me greatly</p>

<p id="id11393">You behaved with great forbearance</p>

<p id="id11394">You can hardly be serious</p>

<p id="id11395">You cannot regret it more than I do</p>

<p id="id11396">You could not pay me a higher compliment</p>

<p id="id11397">You did it excellently</p>

<p id="id11398">You did not clearly understand what I meant</p>

<p id="id11399">You don't seem very enthusiastic</p>

<p id="id11400">You excite my curiosity</p>

<p id="id11401">You flatter my judgment</p>

<p id="id11403">You have asked me a riddle</p>

<p id="id11404">You have asked the impossible</p>

<p id="id11405">You have been wrongly informed</p>

<p id="id11406">You have done me a great service</p>

<p id="id11407">You have had a pleasant time, I hope</p>

<p id="id11408">You have my deepest sympathy</p>

<p id="id11409">You have my unbounded confidence</p>

<p id="id11410">You have received a false impression</p>

<p id="id11411">You have such an interesting way of putting things</p>

<p id="id11412">You interest me deeply</p>

<p id="id11413">You judge yourself too severely</p>

<p id="id11414">You know I'm in an agony of curiosity</p>

<p id="id11415">You know I'm not given to sentimentality</p>

<p id="id11416">You know the familiar axiom</p>

<p id="id11417">You leave no alternative</p>

<p id="id11418">You look incredulous</p>

<p id="id11419">You may be sure of my confidence</p>

<p id="id11420">You may rely on me absolutely</p>

<p id="id11421">You might make an exception</p>

<p id="id11422">You must have misunderstood me</p>

<p id="id11423">You must not fail to command me</p>

<p id="id11424">You overwhelm me with your kindness</p>

<p id="id11425">You really insist upon it?</p>

<p id="id11426">You rebuke me very fairly</p>

<p id="id11427">You say that as though you were surprised</p>

<p id="id11428">You see how widely we differ</p>

<p id="id11429">You see, it's all very vague</p>

<p id="id11430">You see things rose-colored</p>

<p id="id11431">You seem to be in a happy mood</p>

<p id="id11432">You seem to take a very mild interest in what I propose</p>

<p id="id11433">You shock me more than I can say</p>

<p id="id11434">You speak in enigmas</p>

<p id="id11435">You speak with authority</p>

<p id="id11436">You surely understand my position</p>

<p id="id11437">You take a great deal for granted</p>

<p id="id11438">You take a pessimistic view of things</p>

<p id="id11439">You take me quite by surprise</p>

<p id="id11440">You will admit I have some provocation</p>

<p id="id11441">You will become morbid if you are not careful</p>

<p id="id11442">You will have ample opportunity</p>

<p id="id11443">You will, of course, remember the incident</p>

<p id="id11444">You will please not be flippant</p>

<p id="id11445">You will understand my anxiety</p>

<p id="id11446">Your argument is facile and superficial</p>

<p id="id11447">Your consideration is entirely misplaced</p>

<p id="id11448">Your judgments are very sound</p>

<p id="id11449">Your logic is as clever as possible</p>

<p id="id11450">Your opinion will be invaluable to me</p>

<p id="id11451">Your request is granted before it is made</p>

<p id="id11452">Your statement is somewhat startling</p>

<p id="id11476">After full deliberation</p>

<p id="id11477">After reminding the hearer</p>

<p id="id11478">After this it remains only to say</p>

<p id="id11480">Again, I ask the gentleman</p>

<p id="id11481">Again, in this view</p>

<p id="id11482">Again, it is quite clear that</p>

<p id="id11483">Again, it is urged</p>

<p id="id11484">Again, let us compare</p>

<p id="id11485">Again, very numerous are the cases</p>

<p id="id11486">Again, we have abundant instances</p>

<p id="id11487">Against all this concurring testimony</p>

<p id="id11488">All confess this to be true</p>

<p id="id11489">All I ask is</p>

<p id="id11490">All of us know</p>

<p id="id11491">All that I will say now</p>

<p id="id11492">All the facts which support this</p>

<p id="id11493">All the signs of the time indicate</p>

<p id="id11494">All these things you know</p>

<p id="id11495">All this being considered</p>

<p id="id11496">All this is historical fact</p>

<p id="id11497">All this is very well</p>

<p id="id11498">All this suggests</p>

<p id="id11499">All this we take for granted</p>

<p id="id11500">Allow me for a moment to turn to</p>

<p id="id11501">Allow me to tell a story</p>

<p id="id11502">Altho I say it to myself</p>

<p id="id11503">Amazing as it may seem</p>

<p id="id11504">Am I mistaken in this</p>

<p id="id11505">Among many examples</p>

<p id="id11506">Among the distinguished guests who honor</p>

<p id="id11507">Among the problems that confront us</p>

<p id="id11508">An answer to this is now ready</p>

<p id="id11509">An argument has often been put forward</p>

<p id="id11510">An example or two will illustrate</p>

<p id="id11511">An indescribably touching incident</p>

<p id="id11512">An opinion has now become established</p>

<p id="id11513">And again, it is said</p>

<p id="id11514">And again, it is to be presumed</p>

<p id="id11515">And coming nearer to our own day</p>

<p id="id11516">And did a man try to persuade me</p>

<p id="id11517">And do you really think</p>

<p id="id11518">And everybody here knows</p>

<p id="id11519">And for myself, as I said</p>

<p id="id11528">And here I wish you to observe</p>

<p id="id11529">And here let me define my position</p>

<p id="id11530">And here let me give my explanation</p>

<p id="id11531">And here let us recall to mind</p>

<p id="id11532">And how is it possible to imagine</p>

<p id="id11533">And I am bound to say</p>

<p id="id11534">And I beg of you</p>

<p id="id11535">And I call on you</p>

<p id="id11536">And I might say this</p>

<p id="id11537">And I refuse assent</p>

<p id="id11538">And I rejoice to know</p>

<p id="id11539">And I say, it were better for you</p>

<p id="id11540">And I should in like manner repudiate</p>

<p id="id11541">And I speak with reverence</p>

<p id="id11542">And I submit to you</p>

<p id="id11543">And I trust that you will consider</p>

<p id="id11544">And I will make a practical suggestion</p>

<p id="id11545">And I will tell you why</p>

<p id="id11546">And I would, moreover submit</p>

<p id="id11548">And if any of you should question</p>

<p id="id11549">And if I know anything of my countrymen</p>

<p id="id11550">And if I may presume to speak</p>

<p id="id11551">And if I take another instance</p>

<p id="id11552">And if this be true</p>

<p id="id11553">And if you come to a decision</p>

<p id="id11554">And if you think it your duty</p>

<p id="id11556">And in like manner</p>

<p id="id11557">And in order to see this</p>

<p id="id11558">And in thus speaking, I am not denying</p>

<p id="id11559">And is not this lamentable</p>

<p id="id11560">And is there not a presumption</p>

<p id="id11561">And it happens</p>

<p id="id11562">And it is certainly true</p>

<p id="id11563">And it is doubtful if</p>

<p id="id11564">And it is not difficult to see</p>

<p id="id11565">And it is not plain</p>

<p id="id11566">And it is one of the evidences</p>

<p id="id11567">And it is precisely in this</p>

<p id="id11568">And it is strikingly suggested to us</p>

<p id="id11569">And it is undeniable, I say</p>

<p id="id11570">And it is well that this should be so</p>

<p id="id11571">And last of all</p>

<p id="id11572">And lest anyone should marvel</p>

<p id="id11573">And let it be observed</p>

<p id="id11574">And lo! and behold</p>

<p id="id11575">And more than this</p>

<p id="id11576">And next I would ask</p>

<p id="id11577">And now allow me to call attention</p>

<p id="id11578">And now behold a mystery</p>

<p id="id11579">And now consider</p>

<p id="id11580">And now having discussed</p>

<p id="id11581">And now I beg that I may be permitted</p>

<p id="id11582">And now I go back to the statement</p>

<p id="id11583">And now I have completed my review</p>

<p id="id11584">And now I have said enough to explain</p>

<p id="id11585">And now I must touch upon one point</p>

<p id="id11586">And now if I may take for granted</p>

<p id="id11587">And now it would be very pleasant for me</p>

<p id="id11588">And now observe how</p>

<p id="id11589">And now, sir, what I had first to say</p>

<p id="id11590">And now supposing this point to be settled</p>

<p id="id11591">And now that I have mentioned</p>

<p id="id11592">And now the chief points of it</p>

<p id="id11593">And now the question is asked me</p>

<p id="id11594">And now, to close, let me give you</p>

<p id="id11595">And now, to what purpose do I mention</p>

<p id="id11596">And, of course, you are aware</p>

<p id="id11597">And of this I am perfectly certain</p>

<p id="id11598">And quite as difficult is it to create</p>

<p id="id11599">And right here lies the cause</p>

<p id="id11600">And, sir, a word</p>

<p id="id11601">And so, again, as regard</p>

<p id="id11602">And so I am reminded of a story</p>

<p id="id11603">And so I leave these words with you</p>

<p id="id11604">And so I may point out</p>

<p id="id11605">And so I might recount to you</p>

<p id="id11606">And so, in the other cases, I have named</p>

<p id="id11607">And so in the present case</p>

<p id="id11608">And so on</p>

<p id="id11609">And so through all phases</p>

<p id="id11610">And so, upon every hand</p>

<p id="id11611">And sometimes it will be difficult</p>

<p id="id11612">And that gave another distorted view</p>

<p id="id11613">And the reason is very obvious</p>

<p id="id11614">And the same holds good</p>

<p id="id11615">And then again</p>

<p id="id11616">And then hastily to conclude</p>

<p id="id11617">And then I may be reminded</p>

<p id="id11618">And then there is another thought</p>

<p id="id11619">And then when it is said</p>

<p id="id11620">And there are reasons why</p>

<p id="id11621">And there is also this view</p>

<p id="id11622">And therefore am I truly glad</p>

<p id="id11623">And therefore it is not unfrequently quoted</p>

<p id="id11624">And therefore it is not without regret</p>

<p id="id11625">And this brings me to the last thing</p>

<p id="id11626">And this is really the sense</p>

<p id="id11627">And this leads me to say a word</p>

<p id="id11628">And thus consistently</p>

<p id="id11629">And thus it is conceivable</p>

<p id="id11630">And thus it seems to me</p>

<p id="id11631">And thus we are led on then to further question</p>

<p id="id11632">And to all this must be added</p>

<p id="id11633">And to return to the topic</p>

<p id="id11634">And to this conclusion you must come</p>

<p id="id11635">And unquestionably</p>

<p id="id11636">And we are brought to the same conclusion</p>

<p id="id11637">And what do you suppose will be</p>

<p id="id11638">And when I have shown to you</p>

<p id="id11639">And when I recall that event</p>

<p id="id11640">And when we pass beyond the bounds of</p>

<p id="id11641">And where, let me ask</p>

<p id="id11642">And why should I insist</p>

<p id="id11643">And will you still insist</p>

<p id="id11644">And with these thoughts come others</p>

<p id="id11645">And yet I can not but reflect</p>

<p id="id11646">And yet I feel justified in believing</p>

<p id="id11647">And yet I think we all feel</p>

<p id="id11648">And yet let me say to you</p>

<p id="id11649">And yet one more quotation</p>

<p id="id11650">And yet this notion is, I conceive</p>

<p id="id11651">And yet though this be true</p>

<p id="id11652">And yet we ought, if we are wise</p>

<p id="id11653">And you may also remember this</p>

<p id="id11654">Another circumstance that adds to the difficulty</p>

<p id="id11655">Another consideration which I shall adduce   [adduce = cite as an example]</p>

<p id="id11656">Another instance of signal success</p>

<p id="id11657">Another of these presumptions</p>

<p id="id11658">Another point is made as clear as crystal</p>

<p id="id11659">Another reason of a kindred nature</p>

<p id="id11660">Another reflection which occurs to me</p>

<p id="id11661">Another sign of our times</p>

<p id="id11662">Another signal advantage</p>

<p id="id11663">Another striking instance</p>

<p id="id11664">Answers doubtless may be given</p>

<p id="id11665">Are there not many of us</p>

<p id="id11666">Are we content to believe</p>

<p id="id11667">Are we forever to deprive ourselves</p>

<p id="id11668">Are we not startled into astonishment</p>

<p id="id11669">Are we satisfied to assume</p>

<p id="id11670">As a general rule I hold</p>

<p id="id11671">As a last illustration</p>

<p id="id11672">As a matter of fact</p>

<p id="id11673">As a proof of this</p>

<p id="id11674">As an illustration of this truth</p>

<p id="id11675">As briefly as I may</p>

<p id="id11676">As far as my limits allow</p>

<p id="id11677">As far as this is true</p>

<p id="id11678">As far as this objection relates</p>

<p id="id11679">As far as we know</p>

<p id="id11680">As for the rest</p>

<p id="id11681">As I have now replied to</p>

<p id="id11682">As I look around on this assembly</p>

<p id="id11683">As I rise to respond to the sentiment</p>

<p id="id11684">As I understand this matter</p>

<p id="id11685">As memory scans the past</p>

<p id="id11686">As society is now constituted</p>

<p id="id11687">As some one has well said</p>

<p id="id11688">As the foregoing instances have shown</p>

<p id="id11692">Assuredly it is this</p>

<p id="id11693">At the outset of this inquiry</p>

<p id="id11694">At the risk of digression</p>

<p id="id11695">At the same time, I candidly state</p>

<p id="id11696">At the utmost we can say</p>

<p id="id11701">Be assured, then</p>

<p id="id11702">Be confident, therefore</p>

<p id="id11703">Be it so</p>

<p id="id11705">Be sure that in spite of</p>

<p id="id11709">Bearing on this point</p>

<p id="id11710">Before attempting to answer this question</p>

<p id="id11711">Before going further</p>

<p id="id11712">Before I close I will particularly remark</p>

<p id="id11713">Before I come to the special matter</p>

<p id="id11714">Before I proceed to compare</p>

<p id="id11736">But, further, I shall now demonstrate</p>

<p id="id11737">But, gentlemen, I must be done</p>

<p id="id11738">But grave problems confront us</p>

<p id="id11740">But here let me say</p>

<p id="id11741">But how can we pass over</p>

<p id="id11742">But how shall I describe my emotions</p>

<p id="id11743">But however that may be</p>

<p id="id11744">But I am bound to say</p>

<p id="id11745">But I am certain from my own experience</p>

<p id="id11746">But I am very sorry to say</p>

<p id="id11754">But I do not propose all these things</p>

<p id="id11756">But I have been insisting simply</p>

<p id="id11757">But I have heard it argued</p>

<p id="id11758">But I have no fear of the future</p>

<p id="id11759">But I leave this train of thought</p>

<p id="id11770">But I submit the whole subject</p>

<p id="id11771">But I trust that you will all admit</p>

<p id="id11772">But I venture to assure you</p>

<p id="id11773">But I will allude</p>

<p id="id11774">But I will not further impress any idea</p>

<p id="id11775">But I would earnestly impress upon you</p>

<p id="id11776">But if I may even flatter myself</p>

<p id="id11777">But if I seek for illustrations</p>

<p id="id11778">But if you want more evidence</p>

<p id="id11779">But if you wish to know</p>

<p id="id11780">But in making this assertion</p>

<p id="id11781">But in my opinion there is no need</p>

<p id="id11782">But in the course of time</p>

<p id="id11783">But is it quite possible to hold</p>

<p id="id11784">But is this any reason why</p>

<p id="id11785">But it does not follow from this</p>

<p id="id11786">But it happens very fortunately</p>

<p id="id11787">But it has been suggested to me</p>

<p id="id11788">But it is a fact</p>

<p id="id11789">But it is impossible for one</p>

<p id="id11790">But it is necessary to explain</p>

<p id="id11791">But it is no use protesting</p>

<p id="id11792">But it is not fair to assert</p>

<p id="id11793">But it is not my intention</p>

<p id="id11794">But it is not necessary to suppose</p>

<p id="id11795">But it is not possible to believe</p>

<p id="id11796">But it is not really so</p>

<p id="id11797">But it is otherwise with</p>

<p id="id11799">But it may be doubted whether</p>

<p id="id11801">But it will be a misfortune</p>

<p id="id11802">But it will naturally be asked</p>

<p id="id11803">But it will perhaps be argued</p>

<p id="id11804">But it would be vain to attempt</p>

<p id="id11805">But let me ask you to glance</p>

<p id="id11806">But let me before closing refer</p>

<p id="id11807">But let none of you think</p>

<p id="id11808">But let us also keep ever in mind</p>

<p id="id11809">But let us look a little further</p>

<p id="id11810">But lo! all of a sudden</p>

<p id="id11811">But mark this</p>

<p id="id11812">But more than all things else</p>

<p id="id11813">But my allotted time is running away</p>

<p id="id11814">But my answer to this objection</p>

<p id="id11815">But, my friends, pause for a moment</p>

<p id="id11816">But never was a grosser wrong</p>

<p id="id11817">But not for one moment</p>

<p id="id11818">But notwithstanding all this</p>

<p id="id11819">But now look at the effect</p>

<p id="id11823">But passing these by</p>

<p id="id11824">But perhaps I ought to speak distinctly</p>

<p id="id11825">But perhaps you are not yet weary</p>

<p id="id11826">But putting these questions aside</p>

<p id="id11827">But quite contrary to this, you will find</p>

<p id="id11828">But recollect, I pray you, how</p>

<p id="id11829">But, sir, it is manifest</p>

<p id="id11830">But some other things are to be noted</p>

<p id="id11833">But still, I repeat</p>

<p id="id11834">But suppose the fact</p>

<p id="id11836">But that I may not divert you from</p>

<p id="id11845">But, then, let us ask ourselves</p>

<p id="id11846">But there is another duty imposed</p>

<p id="id11847">But there is much more than this</p>

<p id="id11848">But this I do not hesitate to say</p>

<p id="id11849">But this I fearlessly affirm</p>

<p id="id11850">But this I know</p>

<p id="id11851">But this is a circuitous argument</p>

<p id="id11852">But this is no place for controversy</p>

<p id="id11853">But this is not all</p>

<p id="id11854">But this is what I mean</p>

<p id="id11855">But this much I affirm as true</p>

<p id="id11856">But this warns me</p>

<p id="id11864">But we think it is not wise</p>

<p id="id11865">But we want something more for explanation</p>

<p id="id11866">But what a blunder would be yours</p>

<p id="id11867">But what is the fact</p>

<p id="id11868">But what we must needs guard against</p>

<p id="id12143">I am reluctantly but forcibly reminded</p>

<p id="id12144">I am resolved not to permit</p>

<p id="id12145">I am sensible, sir</p>

<p id="id12146">I am simply endeavoring to show</p>

<p id="id12147">I am so surrounded on every hand</p>

<p id="id12148">I am sometimes inclined to think</p>

<p id="id12149">I am somewhat relieved to know</p>

<p id="id12150">I am sorry to say</p>

<p id="id12151">I am suggesting the reason why</p>

<p id="id12176">I am under a very great obligation</p>

<p id="id12177">I am under the deepest feeling of gratitude</p>

<p id="id12178">I am under the impression</p>

<p id="id12179">I am unwillingly bound to add</p>

<p id="id12180">I am uttering no paradox when I say</p>

<p id="id12181">I am very far from thinking.</p>

<p id="id12190">I appeal in the first place</p>

<p id="id12191">I appeal to any man to say</p>

<p id="id12192">I appeal to the better judgment</p>

<p id="id12193">I appreciate the significance</p>

<p id="id12194">I argue this cause</p>

<p id="id12237">I bid you a most cordial and hearty welcome</p>

<p id="id12238">I bow with you in reverent commemoration</p>

<p id="id12239">I call on you to answer</p>

<p id="id12240">I call to mind how</p>

<p id="id12501">I have been requested to say a word</p>

<p id="id12502">I have been told by an eminent authority</p>

<p id="id12503">I have been too long accustomed to hear</p>

<p id="id12504">I have been touched by the large generosity</p>

<p id="id12505">I have been trying to show</p>

<p id="id12506">I have before me the statistics</p>

<p id="id12507">I have but one more word to add</p>

<p id="id12508">I have demonstrated to you</p>

<p id="id12509">I have depicted</p>

<p id="id12510">I have endeavored to emphasize</p>

<p id="id12511">I have enlarged on this subject</p>

<p id="id12512">I have felt it almost a duty to</p>

<p id="id12513">I have found great cause for wonder</p>

<p id="id12514">I have frequently been surprised at</p>

<p id="id12515">I have gazed with admiration</p>

<p id="id12516">I have generally observed</p>

<p id="id12517">I have gone so far as to suggest</p>

<p id="id12518">I have good reason for</p>

<p id="id12519">I have had steadily in mind</p>

<p id="id12520">I have had the honor</p>

<p id="id12521">I have had to take a long sweep</p>

<p id="id12522">I have heard it objected</p>

<p id="id12523">I have heard with relief and pleasure</p>

<p id="id12524">I have hitherto been adducing instances    [adduce = cite as an example]</p>

<p id="id12525">I have hitherto been engaged in showing</p>

<p id="id12526">I have in a measure anticipated</p>

<p id="id12527">I have in my possession</p>

<p id="id12528">I have incidentally dwelt on</p>

<p id="id12529">I have introduced it to suggest</p>

<p id="id12530">I have labored to maintain</p>

<p id="id12531">I have laid much stress upon</p>

<p id="id12532">I have lately observed many strong indications</p>

<p id="id12533">I have listened with the utmost interest</p>

<p id="id12534">I have little hope that I can add anything</p>

<p id="id12535">I have lived to see</p>

<p id="id12536">I have long ago insisted</p>

<p id="id12537">I have long been of the conviction</p>

<p id="id12538">I have never heard it suggested</p>

<p id="id12539">I have never whispered a syllable</p>

<p id="id12540">I have no acquaintance with</p>

<p id="id12541">I have no doubt whatever</p>

<p id="id12542">I have no excuse for intruding</p>

<p id="id12543">I have no fear of myself</p>

<p id="id12544">I have no fears for the success</p>

<p id="id12545">I have no hesitation in asserting</p>

<p id="id12546">I have no intention to moralize</p>

<p id="id12547">I have no particular inclination</p>

<p id="id12548">I have no prejudice on the subject</p>

<p id="id12549">I have no pretention to be regarded</p>

<p id="id12550">I have no reason to think</p>

<p id="id12551">I have no scruple in saying</p>

<p id="id12552">I have no such gloomy forebodings</p>

<p id="id12553">I have no sympathy with the men</p>

<p id="id12554">I have no thought of venturing to say</p>

<p id="id12555">I have no wish at all to preach</p>

<p id="id12556">I have not accustomed myself</p>

<p id="id12557">I have not allowed myself</p>

<p id="id12558">I have not been able to deny</p>

<p id="id12559">I have not particularly referred to</p>

<p id="id12560">I have not said anything yet</p>

<p id="id12561">I have not the means of forming a judgment</p>

<p id="id12562">I have not the right to reproach</p>

<p id="id12563">I have not time to present</p>

<p id="id12564">I have nothing more to say</p>

<p id="id12565">I have noticed of late years</p>

<p id="id12566">I have now explained to you</p>

<p id="id12567">I have now made bold to touch upon</p>

<p id="id12568">I have now rather more than kept my word</p>

<p id="id12569">I have now said all that occurs to me</p>

<p id="id12570">I have often been impressed with</p>

<p id="id12571">I have often been struck with the resemblance</p>

<p id="id12572">I have often lingered in fancy</p>

<p id="id12573">I have one step farther to go</p>

<p id="id12574">I have only partially examined</p>

<p id="id12575">I have partly anticipated</p>

<p id="id12576">I have pleasant memories of</p>

<p id="id12577">I have pointed out</p>

<p id="id12578">I have pride and pleasure in quoting</p>

<p id="id12579">I have racked this brain of mine</p>

<p id="id12580">I have read with great regret</p>

<p id="id12581">I have said and I repeat</p>

<p id="id12582">I have said over and over again</p>

<p id="id12583">I have said what I solemnly believe</p>

<p id="id12584">I have scant patience</p>

<p id="id12585">I have seen for myself</p>

<p id="id12586">I have seen it stated in a recent journal</p>

<p id="id12587">I have seen some signs of encouragement</p>

<p id="id12588">I have shown</p>

<p id="id12589">I have some sort of fear</p>

<p id="id12590">I have sometimes asked myself</p>

<p id="id12591">I have sometimes fancied</p>

<p id="id12592">I have sometimes wondered whether</p>

<p id="id12593">I have still two comments to make</p>

<p id="id12594">I have taken pains to know</p>

<p id="id12595">I have the confident hope</p>

<p id="id12596">I have the greatest possible confidence</p>

<p id="id12597">I have the honor to propose</p>

<p id="id12598">I have then to investigate</p>

<p id="id12599">I have thought it incumbent on me</p>

<p id="id12600">I have thought it right on this day</p>

<p id="id12601">I have thought it well to suggest</p>

<p id="id12602">I have throughout highly appreciated</p>

<p id="id12603">I have thus been led by my feelings</p>

<p id="id12604">I have thus stated the reason</p>

<p id="id12605">I have to confess with a feeling of melancholy</p>

<p id="id12606">I have to force my imagination</p>

<p id="id12607">I have touched very cursorily</p>

<p id="id12608">I have tried to convey to you</p>

<p id="id12609">I have undertaken to speak</p>

<p id="id12610">I have very much less feeling of</p>

<p id="id12611">I have watched with some attention</p>

<p id="id12612">I have witnessed the extraordinary</p>

<p id="id12613">I have yet a more cogent reason</p>

<p id="id12614">I have yet to learn</p>

<p id="id12615">I hazard nothing in saying</p>

<p id="id12616">I hear it sometimes said</p>

<p id="id12617">I hear you say to yourselves</p>

<p id="id12618">I heartily feel the singular claims</p>

<p id="id12619">I hesitate to take an instance</p>

<p id="id12620">I hold it to be clearly expedient</p>

<p id="id12621">I hold myself obliged to</p>

<p id="id12622">I hold the maxim no less applicable</p>

<p id="id12623">I hold this to be a truth</p>

<p id="id12624">I hold to the principle</p>

<p id="id12625">I hope by this time we are all convinced</p>

<p id="id12626">I hope for our own sakes</p>

<p id="id12627">I hope I have expressed myself explicitly</p>

<p id="id12628">I hope I may be allowed to intimate</p>

<p id="id12629">I hope I shall not be told</p>

<p id="id12630">I hope it is no disparagement</p>

<p id="id12631">I hope most sincerely and truly</p>

<p id="id12632">I hope none who hear me</p>

<p id="id12633">I hope not to occupy more than a few minutes</p>

<p id="id12634">I hope that I shall not be so unfortunate</p>

<p id="id12635">I hope the day may be far distant</p>

<p id="id12636">I hope the time may come again</p>

<p id="id12637">I hope to be excused if</p>

<p id="id12638">I hope to be forgiven if</p>

<p id="id12639">I hope we may forget</p>

<p id="id12640">I hope you will not accuse me</p>

<p id="id12641">I imagine that no one will be disposed</p>

<p id="id12642">I insist upon it</p>

<p id="id12643">I intend to propose</p>

<p id="id12644">I know from experience how</p>

<p id="id12645">I know full well</p>

<p id="id12646">I know I am treading on thin ice</p>

<p id="id12647">I know it has been questioned</p>

<p id="id12648">I know it is said</p>

<p id="id12649">I know it will be said</p>

<p id="id12650">I know many reasons why</p>

<p id="id12651">I know not how else to express</p>

<p id="id12652">I know not in what direction to look</p>

<p id="id12653">I know not of my own knowledge</p>

<p id="id12654">I know not where else to find</p>

<p id="id12655">I know perfectly well</p>

<p id="id12656">I know that it is impossible for me to</p>

<p id="id12657">I know that this is the feeling</p>

<p id="id12658">I know that what I may say is true</p>

<p id="id12659">I know there are some who think</p>

<p id="id12660">I know there is a theory among us</p>

<p id="id12661">I know too well</p>

<p id="id12662">I know very well the difference between</p>

<p id="id12663">I know well it is not for me</p>

<p id="id12664">I know well the sentiments</p>

<p id="id12665">I know you are all impatient to hear</p>

<p id="id12666">I know you will do all in your power</p>

<p id="id12667">I know you will interpret what I say</p>

<p id="id12668">I labor under a degree of prejudice</p>

<p id="id12669">I lately heard it affirmed</p>

<p id="id12670">I lay it down as a principle</p>

<p id="id12671">I leave history to judge</p>

<p id="id12672">I leave it to you</p>

<p id="id12673">I leave the arduous task</p>

<p id="id12674">I leave to others to speak</p>

<p id="id12675">I long to speak a word or two</p>

<p id="id12676">I look hopefully to</p>

<p id="id12677">I look in vain</p>

<p id="id12678">I look with encouragement</p>

<p id="id12679">I look with inexpressible dread</p>

<p id="id12680">I look with mingled hope and terror</p>

<p id="id12681">I make my appeal to</p>

<p id="id12682">I make no extravagant claim</p>

<p id="id12683">I make this abrupt acknowledgment</p>

<p id="id12684">I marvel that</p>

<p id="id12685">I may add, speaking for my own part</p>

<p id="id12686">I may be allowed to make one remark</p>

<p id="id12687">I may be permitted to add</p>

<p id="id12688">I may confess to you</p>

<p id="id12689">I may safely appeal</p>

<p id="id12690">I may say to you calmly</p>

<p id="id12691">I may seem to have been diffuse</p>

<p id="id12692">I may take as an instance</p>

<p id="id12693">I may venture upon a review</p>

<p id="id12694">I mean by this</p>

<p id="id12695">I mean, moreover</p>

<p id="id12696">I mean something more than that</p>

<p id="id12697">I mention it to you to justify</p>

<p id="id12698">I mention these facts because</p>

<p id="id12699">I mention this, not by way of complaint</p>

<p id="id12700">I might bring you another such case</p>

<p id="id12701">I might deny that</p>

<p id="id12702">I might enter into such detail</p>

<p id="id12703">I might go further</p>

<p id="id12704">I might go on indefinitely</p>

<p id="id12705">I might go on to illustrate</p>

<p id="id12706">I might of course point first</p>

<p id="id12707">I might reasonably question the justice</p>

<p id="id12708">I might try to explain</p>

<p id="id12709">I might venture to claim</p>

<p id="id12710">I might well have desired</p>

<p id="id12711">I might well think</p>

<p id="id12712">I must ask an abrupt question</p>

<p id="id12713">I must be careful about what I say</p>

<p id="id12714">I must be contented with</p>

<p id="id12715">I must be excused if I say</p>

<p id="id12716">I must bow in reverence</p>

<p id="id12717">I must call your attention for a moment</p>

<p id="id12718">I must conclude abruptly</p>

<p id="id12719">I must confess that I became rather alarmed</p>

<p id="id12720">I must consider this as</p>

<p id="id12721">I must crave your indulgence</p>

<p id="id12722">I must express to you again</p>

<p id="id12723">I must fairly tell you</p>

<p id="id12724">I must find some fault with</p>

<p id="id12725">I must for want of time omit</p>

<p id="id12726">I must here admit</p>

<p id="id12727">I must lament</p>

<p id="id12728">I must leave any detailed development</p>

<p id="id12729">I must mention with praise</p>

<p id="id12730">I must not allow myself to indulge</p>

<p id="id12731">I must not for an instant be supposed</p>

<p id="id12732">I must not overlook</p>

<p id="id12733">I must now beg to ask</p>

<p id="id12734">I must pause a moment to</p>

<p id="id12735">I must proceed</p>

<p id="id12736">I must qualify the statement</p>

<p id="id12737">I must remind my hearers of</p>

<p id="id12738">I must reply to some observations</p>

<p id="id12739">I must return to the subject</p>

<p id="id12740">I must say that I am one of those</p>

<p id="id12741">I must speak plainly</p>

<p id="id12742">I must suppose, however</p>

<p id="id12743">I must take occasion to say</p>

<p id="id12744">I must thank you once more</p>

<p id="id12745">I must try to describe to you</p>

<p id="id12746">I myself have boundless faith</p>

<p id="id12747">I need not assure this brilliant company</p>

<p id="id12748">I need not dwell</p>

<p id="id12749">I need not enter into</p>

<p id="id12750">I need not follow out the application</p>

<p id="id12751">I need not, I am certain, assure you</p>

<p id="id12752">I need not say how much I thank you</p>

<p id="id12753">I need not show how inconsistent</p>

<p id="id12754">I need not specially recommend to you</p>

<p id="id12755">I need not wander far in search</p>

<p id="id12756">I need only to observe</p>

<p id="id12757">I need say nothing in praise</p>

<p id="id12758">I need scarcely observe</p>

<p id="id12759">I need to guard myself right here</p>

<p id="id12760">I neither affirm nor deny</p>

<p id="id12761">I next come to the implicit assumption</p>

<p id="id12762">I note with particular pleasure</p>

<p id="id12763">I notice it as affording an instance</p>

<p id="id12764">I noticed incidentally the fact</p>

<p id="id12765">I now address you on a question</p>

<p id="id12766">I now come, sir, to the second head</p>

<p id="id12767">I now have the pleasure of presenting to you</p>

<p id="id12768">I now pass to the question of</p>

<p id="id12769">I now proceed to inquire</p>

<p id="id12770">I now reiterate</p>

<p id="id12771">I object strongly to the use</p>

<p id="id12772">I observe, then, in the first place</p>

<p id="id12773">I only ask a favorable construction of</p>

<p id="id12774">I only marvel</p>

<p id="id12775">I only wish you to recognize</p>

<p id="id12776">I open the all-important question</p>

<p id="id12777">I ought to give an illustration</p>

<p id="id12778">I own I can not help feeling</p>

<p id="id12779">I particularly allude to</p>

<p id="id12780">I pass on from that</p>

<p id="id12781">I pass then to our second division</p>

<p id="id12782">I pause for a moment to say</p>

<p id="id12783">I pause to confess once more</p>

<p id="id12784">I pay tribute to</p>

<p id="id12785">I personally know that it is so</p>

<p id="id12786">I pray God I may never</p>

<p id="id12787">I predict that you will</p>

<p id="id12788">I prefer a practical view</p>

<p id="id12789">I presume I shall have to admit</p>

<p id="id12790">I presume that I shall not be disbelieved</p>

<p id="id12791">I proceed to another important phase</p>

<p id="id12792">I profess</p>

<p id="id12793">I propose briefly to glance at</p>

<p id="id12794">I propose, therefore to consider</p>

<p id="id12795">I protest I never had any doubt</p>

<p id="id12796">I purposely have avoided</p>

<p id="id12797">I question whether</p>

<p id="id12798">I quite endorse what has been said</p>

<p id="id12799">I rather look forward to a time</p>

<p id="id12800">I readily grant</p>

<p id="id12801">I really can not think it necessary to</p>

<p id="id12802">I really do not know</p>

<p id="id12803">I really thought that you would excuse me</p>

<p id="id12804">I recall another historical fact</p>

<p id="id12805">I recognize the high compliment conveyed</p>

<p id="id12806">I recollect hearing a sagacious remark    [sagacious = sound judgment]</p>

<p id="id12807">I refer especially</p>

<p id="id12808">I refuse to believe</p>

<p id="id12809">I regard as an erroneous view</p>

<p id="id12810">I regard it as a tribute</p>

<p id="id12811">I regard it as a very great honor</p>

<p id="id12812">I regret that I am not able to remember</p>

<p id="id12813">I regret that it is not possible for me</p>

<p id="id12814">I regret the time limits me</p>

<p id="id12815">I regret this the less</p>

<p id="id12816">I rejoice in an occasion like this</p>

<p id="id12817">I rejoice that events have occurred</p>

<p id="id12818">I rejoice to think I remark here</p>

<p id="id12819">I remember a reference made</p>

<p id="id12820">I remember an intimation</p>

<p id="id12821">I remember full well</p>

<p id="id12822">I remember the enjoyment with which</p>

<p id="id12823">I remember to have heard</p>

<p id="id12824">I repeat, I am not speaking</p>

<p id="id12825">I repeat my statement in another form</p>

<p id="id12826">I respectfully counsel</p>

<p id="id12827">I respectfully submit</p>

<p id="id12828">I rest my opinion on</p>

<p id="id12829">I rise in behalf</p>

<p id="id12830">I rise to express my disapprobation   [approbation = warm approval; praise]</p>

<p id="id12831">I rise to thank you</p>

<p id="id12832">I rise with some trepidation</p>

<p id="id12833">I return, in conclusion, to</p>

<p id="id12834">I return you my most grateful thanks</p>

<p id="id12835">I said a little way back</p>

<p id="id12836">I said it would be well</p>

<p id="id12837">I said that I thought</p>

<p id="id12838">I salute with profound reverence</p>

<p id="id12839">I sanction with all my heart</p>

<p id="id12840">I saw an ingenious argument the other day</p>

<p id="id12841">I say frankly</p>

<p id="id12842">I say in moderation</p>

<p id="id12843">I say it is extremely important</p>

<p id="id12844">I say it most confidently</p>

<p id="id12845">I say no more of these things</p>

<p id="id12846">I say not one syllable against</p>

<p id="id12847">I say, then, my first point is</p>

<p id="id12848">I say this is no disparagement of</p>

<p id="id12849">I say this the more gladly</p>

<p id="id12850">I say without fear of contradiction</p>

<p id="id12851">I see around me</p>

<p id="id12852">I see as clearly as any man possibly can</p>

<p id="id12853">I see little hope of</p>

<p id="id12854">I see no exception</p>

<p id="id12855">I see no possibility of</p>

<p id="id12856">I see no reason for doubting</p>

<p id="id12857">I seem to hear you say</p>

<p id="id12858">I seize upon this opportunity</p>

<p id="id12859">I seriously desire</p>

<p id="id12860">I set out with saying</p>

<p id="id12861">I shall add a few words</p>

<p id="id12862">I shall address myself to a single point</p>

<p id="id12863">I shall ask you to look very closely</p>

<p id="id12864">I shall be told</p>

<p id="id12865">I shall best attain my object</p>

<p id="id12866">I shall bestow a little attention upon</p>

<p id="id12867">I shall certainly admit</p>

<p id="id13601">It is well known</p>

<p id="id13602">It is with great pleasure</p>

<p id="id13603">It is with pity unspeakable</p>

<p id="id13604">It is within the memory of men now living</p>

<p id="id13616">It may not be altogether certain</p>

<p id="id13617">It may not be uninteresting to any of you</p>

<p id="id13618">It may or may not be true</p>

<p id="id13619">It may, perhaps, seem wonderful</p>

<p id="id13620">It may seem a little strange</p>

<p id="id13621">It may still more probably be said</p>

<p id="id13622">It must be a cause of delight</p>

<p id="id13623">It must be borne in mind</p>

<p id="id13624">It must be the verdict of history</p>

<p id="id13625">It must create astonishment</p>

<p id="id13626">It must doubtless be admitted</p>

<p id="id13628">It must never be forgotten</p>

<p id="id13629">It must not be supposed</p>

<p id="id13630">It must seem to every thoughtful man</p>

<p id="id13631">It needs scarcely be said</p>

<p id="id13632">It now becomes my pride and privilege</p>

<p id="id13633">It only remains now to speak</p>

<p id="id13634">It ought to animate us</p>

<p id="id13635">It proves a great deal</p>

<p id="id13637">It remains that I inform you of</p>

<p id="id13638">It remains that I should say a few words</p>

<p id="id13639">It reminds me of an anecdote</p>

<p id="id13640">It reminds one of the compliment</p>

<p id="id13641">It requires no effort of imagination</p>

<p id="id13642">It scarcely seems to be in keeping</p>

<p id="id13643">It seems almost desperate to think of</p>

<p id="id13644">It seems almost incredible</p>

<p id="id13645">It seems now to be generally admitted</p>

<p id="id13646">It seems strange to be told</p>

<p id="id13647">It seems then that on the whole</p>

<p id="id13648">It seems to me a striking circumstance</p>

<p id="id13649">It seems to me idle to ask</p>

<p id="id13650">It seems to me singularly appropriate</p>

<p id="id13651">It seems to me the primary foundation</p>

<p id="id13652">It seems to me unphilosophical</p>

<p id="id13653">It should always be borne in mind</p>

<p id="id13654">It should be remembered</p>

<p id="id13655">It so happens</p>

<p id="id13656">It sometimes seems to me</p>

<p id="id13657">It still remains to be observed</p>

<p id="id13658">It strikes me with wonder</p>

<p id="id13659">It suggests at the outset</p>

<p id="id13660">It summons our imagination</p>

<p id="id13661">It surely is not too much to expect</p>

<p id="id13666">It was a fit and beautiful circumstance</p>

<p id="id13667">It was a propitious circumstance    [propitious = auspicious, favorable]</p>

<p id="id13668">It was certainly a gracious act</p>

<p id="id13669">It was in the full understanding</p>

<p id="id13670">It was my good fortune</p>

<p id="id13671">It was not to be expected</p>

<p id="id13672">It was said by one who ought to know</p>

<p id="id13673">It was, therefore, inevitable</p>

<p id="id13674">It was under these circumstances</p>

<p id="id13675">It will appeal to</p>

<p id="id13677">It will be asked me how</p>

<p id="id13678">It will be easy to say too much</p>

<p id="id13679">It will be easy to trace the influence</p>

<p id="id13680">It will be evident to you</p>

<p id="id13681">It will be idle to imply</p>

<p id="id13682">It will be interesting to trace</p>

<p id="id13683">It will be just as reasonable to say</p>

<p id="id13684">It will be rather to our advantage</p>

<p id="id13685">It will be recollected</p>

<p id="id13686">It will be seen at a glance</p>

<p id="id13687">It will be well and wise</p>

<p id="id13688">It will carry out my meaning more fully</p>

<p id="id13690">It will not be expected from me</p>

<p id="id13691">It will not be safe</p>

<p id="id13692">It will not do for a man to say</p>

<p id="id13693">It will not, I trust, be concluded</p>

<p id="id13694">It will not surely be objected</p>

<p id="id13695">It will not take many words to sum up</p>

<p id="id13964">Now, I understand the argument</p>

<p id="id13965">Now, I will undertake to say</p>

<p id="id13966">Now, I wish to call your attention</p>

<p id="id13967">Now, if you will clearly understand</p>

<p id="id13968">Now, is there any ground or basis for</p>

<p id="id13969">Now, it is an undoubted fact</p>

<p id="id13970">Now, it is evident</p>

<p id="id13971">Now, it is not at all strange</p>

<p id="id13972">Now, it is unquestioned</p>

<p id="id13973">Now, let me speak with the greatest care</p>

<p id="id13974">Now, let me stop a moment</p>

<p id="id13975">Now, let us consider</p>

<p id="id13976">Now, observe, my drift</p>

<p id="id13977">Now, sir, I am truly horrified</p>

<p id="id13978">Now, the answer we should give</p>

<p id="id13979">Now, the question here at issue</p>

<p id="id13980">Now, the world will say</p>

<p id="id13981">Now, there is a close alliance between</p>

<p id="id13982">Now, this is precisely the danger</p>

<p id="id13983">Now, this is to some extent</p>

<p id="id13984">Now, understand me definitely</p>

<p id="id13985">Now, we do not maintain</p>

<p id="id13986">Now, we will inquire</p>

<p id="id13987">Now, what I want you to realize</p>

<p id="id13988">Now, with regard to</p>

<p id="id13989">Now, you will allow me to state</p>

<p id="id13990">Now, you will understand from this</p>

<h4 id="id13991" style="margin-top: 2em">O</h4>

<p id="id13992">Observe again</p>

<p id="id13993">Occasionally you ought to read</p>

<p id="id13994">Of course I am aware</p>

<p id="id13995">Of course I am putting an impossible case</p>

<p id="id13996">Of course I can not be taken to mean</p>

<p id="id13997">Of course I do not maintain</p>

<p id="id13998">Of course I do not stop here</p>

<p id="id13999">Of course I would not allow</p>

<p id="id14000">Of course much may be said</p>

<p id="id14001">Of course these remarks hold good</p>

<p id="id14002">Of course we may, if we please</p>

<p id="id14003">Of course you will sympathize</p>

<p id="id14004">Of one thing, however, I am certain</p>

<p id="id14005">Of this briefly</p>

<p id="id14006">Of this statement I will only say</p>

<p id="id14007">Of this truth I shall convince you by</p>

<p id="id14008">On a review of the whole subject</p>

<p id="id14009">On occasions of this kind</p>

<p id="id14010">On such a day as this</p>

<p id="id14011">On the contrary, I am assuming</p>

<p id="id14012">On the occasion to which I refer</p>

<p id="id14013">On the other hand, it is clear</p>

<p id="id14014">On the whole, then, I observe</p>

<p id="id14015">On this auspicious occasion</p>

<p id="id14016">On this point I do not mean to dwell</p>

<p id="id14017">On this subject you need not suspect</p>

<p id="id14018">Once again, there are those</p>

<p id="id14019">Once more I emphasize</p>

<p id="id14020">Once more let me try to put into words</p>

<p id="id14021">One additional remark</p>

<p id="id14022">One almost wishes</p>

<p id="id14023">One can not decline to note</p>

<p id="id14024">One concluding remark has to be made</p>

<p id="id14025">One fact is clear and indisputable</p>

<p id="id14026">One further word</p>

<p id="id14027">One important topic remains</p>

<p id="id14028">One is fairly tempted to wish</p>

<p id="id14029">One lesson history may be said to repeat</p>

<p id="id14030">One might be challenged to produce</p>

<p id="id14031">One of the ancients said</p>

<p id="id14032">One of the most commonly known</p>

<p id="id14033">One of the most extraordinary incidents</p>

<p id="id14034">One of the things I recollect with most pride</p>

<p id="id14035">One of these signs is the fact</p>

<p id="id14036">One or two points are made clear</p>

<p id="id14037">One other circumstance</p>

<p id="id14038">One other remark suggests itself</p>

<p id="id14039">One remark I will make</p>

<p id="id14040">One thing more will complete this question</p>

<p id="id14041">One thing which always impressed me</p>

<p id="id14042">One very striking tendency</p>

<p id="id14043">One word in courtesy I must say</p>

<p id="id14044">One word more in a serious vein</p>

<p id="id14045">One would naturally suppose</p>

<p id="id14046">Only so much do I know</p>

<p id="id14047">Opinions are divided as to whether</p>

<p id="id14049">Or to take but one other example</p>

<p id="id14050">Ordinarily speaking, such deductions</p>

<p id="id14051">Others may hold other opinions</p>

<p id="id14052">Ought we not to think</p>

<p id="id14053">Our thoughts wander back</p>

<p id="id14054">Over and above all this</p>

<h4 id="id14055" style="margin-top: 2em">P</h4>

<p id="id14056">Pardon me if</p>

<p id="id14057">Perhaps another reason why</p>

<p id="id14058">Perhaps, however, in speaking to you</p>

<p id="id14059">Perhaps, however, some among you will be</p>

<p id="id14060">Perhaps I may be best able to illustrate</p>

<p id="id14061">Perhaps I ought to say</p>

<p id="id14063">Perhaps, sir, I am mistaken in</p>

<p id="id14065">Permit me to add another circumstance</p>

<p id="id14066">Permit me to bring home to you</p>

<p id="id14067">Personally, I am far too firm a believer</p>

<p id="id14070">Read but your history aright</p>

<p id="id14071">Recollect, sir</p>

<p id="id14072">Reflections such as these</p>

<p id="id14073">Rely upon it</p>

<p id="id14074">Remember, I do not seek to</p>

<p id="id14075">Remembering some past occurrences</p>

<p id="id14076">Returning, then, to the consideration</p>

<h4 id="id14077" style="margin-top: 2em">S</h4>

<p id="id14078">Seriously, then, do I beg you</p>

<p id="id14079">Shall I tell you</p>

<p id="id14080">Shall we complain</p>

<p id="id14081">Should there be objection, I answer</p>

<p id="id14082">Since, then, it is provided</p>

<p id="id14083">Since, then, this is the case</p>

<p id="id14084">Sir, with all my heart, I respond</p>

<p id="id14085">So accustomed are we</p>

<p id="id14086">So at least it seems to me</p>

<p id="id14087">So far as I know</p>

<p id="id14088">So far as my observation and experience goes</p>

<p id="id14089">So far in general</p>

<p id="id14090">So I say to you</p>

<p id="id14091">So it comes to pass</p>

<p id="id14092">So long as we continue to love truth and duty</p>

<p id="id14093">So men are asking</p>

<p id="id14094">So much at first sight</p>

<p id="id14095">So much on this subject</p>

<p id="id14096">So that I may venture to say</p>

<p id="id14097">So that if you were persuaded</p>

<p id="id14098">So then ought we also</p>

<p id="id14099">So, to add one other example</p>

<p id="id14100">So, too, I may go on to speak</p>

<p id="id14101">So when I hear people say</p>

<p id="id14102">Some have insisted</p>

<p id="id14103">Some of you can recall the time</p>

<p id="id14104">Some of you may think this visionary</p>

<p id="id14105">Some of you will remember</p>

<p id="id14106">Some one will perhaps object</p>

<p id="id14107">Some prejudice is attached</p>

<p id="id14108">Some writer has said</p>

<p id="id14109">Sometimes I venture to think</p>

<p id="id14110">Sometimes it may happen</p>

<p id="id14111">Speaking in this place</p>

<p id="id14112">Startling as this may appear to you</p>

<p id="id14113">Stating only the truth, I affirm</p>

<p id="id14114">Still another encouraging fact</p>

<p id="id14115">Still further</p>

<p id="id14116">Still I can not part from my subject</p>

<p id="id14117">Still I have generally found</p>

<p id="id14118">Still I imagine you would consider it</p>

<p id="id14119">Still I know what answer I can make to</p>

<p id="id14120">Still it may with justice be said</p>

<p id="id14121">Still one thing more</p>

<p id="id14122">Still we ought to be grateful</p>

<p id="id14123">Strange as it may seem</p>

<p id="id14124">Strictly in confidence, I do not think</p>

<p id="id14125">Strictly speaking, there is no such thing</p>

<p id="id14126">Such a doctrine is essentially superficial</p>

<p id="id14127">Such are the rather tolerant ideas</p>

<p id="id14128">Such considerations as these</p>

<p id="id14129">Such, I believe, would be the consequences</p>

<p id="id14130">Such illustrations are not frequent</p>

<p id="id14131">Such, in brief, is the story</p>

<p id="id14132">Such is steadfastly my opinion</p>

<p id="id14133">Such is the deep prejudice now existing</p>

<p id="id14134">Such is the intellectual view we take</p>

<p id="id14135">Such is the lesson which I am taught</p>

<p id="id14136">Such is the progress</p>

<p id="id14137">Such is the truth</p>

<p id="id14138">Such, sir, I conceive to be</p>

<p id="id14149">Take another instance</p>

<p id="id14150">Take one of the most recent cases</p>

<p id="id14151">Take the simple fact</p>

<p id="id14153">Taking a broader view</p>

<p id="id14154">Taking the facts by themselves</p>

<p id="id14158">That is all that it seems necessary to me</p>

<p id="id14159">That is all very good</p>

<p id="id14160">That is far from my thoughts</p>

<p id="id14161">That is final and conclusive</p>

<p id="id14331">There is no worse perversion</p>

<p id="id14332">There is not a shadow of evidence</p>

<p id="id14333">There is nothing more repulsive</p>

<p id="id14334">There is nothing overstated in this description</p>

<p id="id14335">There is nothing to show</p>

<p id="id14336">There is one story which it is said</p>

<p id="id14337">There is only one sense in which</p>

<p id="id14338">There is some difference of opinion</p>

<p id="id14339">There is something strangely interesting</p>

<p id="id14340">There is yet another distinction</p>

<p id="id14341">There is yet one other remark</p>

<p id="id14342">There ought certainly to be</p>

<p id="id14343">There was but one alternative</p>

<p id="id14344">There was one remarkable incident</p>

<p id="id14345">There will always be a number of men</p>

<p id="id14346">There will be no difficulty</p>

<p id="id14347">There yet remains</p>

<p id="id14348">Therefore, there is no possibility of a doubt</p>

<p id="id14349">Therein lies your responsibility</p>

<p id="id14350">These alone would not be sufficient</p>

<p id="id14351">These are enough to refute the opinion</p>

<p id="id14352">These are general counsels</p>

<p id="id14353">These are generalizations</p>

<p id="id14354">These are my reasons for</p>

<p id="id14355">These are points for consideration</p>

<p id="id14356">These considerations have great weight with me</p>

<p id="id14357">These exceptions do not hold in the case of</p>

<p id="id14358">These ideas naturally present themselves</p>

<p id="id14359">These instances are far from common</p>

<p id="id14360">These instances are indications</p>

<p id="id14361">These last words lead me to say</p>

<p id="id14362">These objections only go to show</p>

<p id="id14363">These questions I shall examine</p>

<p id="id14364">These various partial views</p>

<p id="id14365">They mistake the intelligence</p>

<p id="id14366">They would persuade you to</p>

<p id="id14367">Think for a moment</p>

<p id="id14368">Think of the cool disregard</p>

<p id="id14369">This absurdity arises</p>

<p id="id14370">This appeal to the common sense</p>

<p id="id14371">This argument is especially cogent     [cogent = powerfully persuasive]</p>

<p id="id14372">This, at least, is sure</p>

<p id="id14373">This being the case</p>

<p id="id14374">This being true</p>

<p id="id14375">This being undeniable, it is plain</p>

<p id="id14376">This being understood, I ask</p>

<p id="id14377">This brings me to a single remark</p>

<p id="id14378">This brings us to a subject</p>

<p id="id14379">This episode goes to prove</p>

<p id="id14380">This fact was soon made manifest</p>

<p id="id14381">This from the nature of the case</p>

<p id="id14382">This I conceive to be the business</p>

<p id="id14383">This I consider to be my own case</p>

<p id="id14384">This I have told you</p>

<p id="id14385">This is a general statement</p>

<p id="id14386">This is a very one-sided conception</p>

<p id="id14387">This is a very serious situation</p>

<p id="id14388">This is an astonishing announcement</p>

<p id="id14389">This is conceded by</p>

<p id="id14390">This is contrary to all argument</p>

<p id="id14391">This is doubtless the truth</p>

<p id="id14392">This is especially the case</p>

<p id="id14393">This is essentially an age of</p>

<p id="id14394">This is in the main just</p>

<p id="id14395">This is like saying</p>

<p id="id14396">This is not all</p>

<p id="id14397">This is not the main point of objection</p>

<p id="id14398">This is not the occasion or the place</p>

<p id="id14399">This is obvious</p>

<p id="id14400">This is on the whole reasonable</p>

<p id="id14401">This is only another illustration of</p>

<p id="id14402">This is owing in great measure to</p>

<p id="id14403">This is precisely what we ought to do</p>

<p id="id14404">This is said in no spirit of</p>

<p id="id14405">This is suggested to us</p>

<p id="id14406">This is the design and intention</p>

<p id="id14407">This is the great fact</p>

<p id="id14408">This is the main point on which the inquiry turns</p>

<p id="id14409">This is the meaning of</p>

<p id="id14410">This is the obvious answer</p>

<p id="id14411">This is the point I want to impress upon you</p>

<p id="id14412">This is the point of view</p>

<p id="id14413">This is the position of our minds</p>

<p id="id14414">This is the radical question</p>

<p id="id14415">This is the sentiment of mankind</p>

<p id="id14416">This is the starting-point</p>

<p id="id14417">This is the sum</p>

<p id="id14418">This is to be found in the fact</p>

<p id="id14419">This is what I am led to say</p>

<p id="id14420">This is what may be objected</p>

<p id="id14421">This is why I take the liberty</p>

<p id="id14422">This language is plain</p>

<p id="id14423">This leads me to the question</p>

<p id="id14424">This leads us to inquire</p>

<p id="id14425">This may be said without prejudice</p>

<p id="id14426">This might be illustrated at length</p>

<p id="id14427">This much is certain</p>

<p id="id14428">This sentiment was well-nigh universal</p>

<p id="id14429">This, surely, is the conclusion</p>

<p id="id14430">This, then, is the answer</p>

<p id="id14431">This, then, is the drift of my illustration</p>

<p id="id14432">This, then, is what I mean by saying</p>

<p id="id14433">This will be evident at once</p>

<p id="id14434">This you can not deny</p>

<p id="id14435">Those who have watched the tendencies</p>

<p id="id14436">Thus a great deal may be done</p>

<p id="id14437">Thus analogy suggests</p>

<p id="id14438">Thus far, I willingly admit</p>

<p id="id14439">Thus I am led on to another remark</p>

<p id="id14440">Thus if you look into</p>

<p id="id14441">Thus instances occur now and then</p>

<p id="id14442">Thus it comes to pass</p>

<p id="id14443">Thus my imagination tells me</p>

<p id="id14444">Thus much, however, I may say</p>

<p id="id14445">Thus much I may be allowed to say</p>

<p id="id14446">Thus much may be sufficient to recall</p>

<p id="id14447">Thus we see</p>

<p id="id14448">Time would not permit me</p>

<p id="id14449">To a man of the highest public spirit</p>

<p id="id14450">To avoid all possibility of being misunderstood</p>

<p id="id14451">To be more explicit</p>

<p id="id14452">To be sure, we sometimes hear</p>

<p id="id14453">To bring the matter nearer home</p>

<p id="id14454">To convince them of this</p>

<p id="id14455">To feel the true force of this argument</p>

<p id="id14456">To illustrate</p>

<p id="id14457">To make my story quite complete</p>

<p id="id14458">To me, however, it would appear</p>

<p id="id14459">To my way of conceiving such matters</p>

<p id="id14460">To prevent misapprehension</p>

<p id="id14461">To some it may sound like a paradox</p>

<p id="id14462">To sum up all that has been said</p>

<p id="id14463">To sum up in one word</p>

<p id="id14464">To take a very different instance</p>

<p id="id14465">To the conclusion thus drawn</p>

<p id="id14466">To the enormous majority of persons</p>

<p id="id14467">To these general considerations</p>

<p id="id14468">To this I answer</p>

<p id="id14469">To this it will be replied</p>

<p id="id14470">To what other cause can you ascribe</p>

<p id="id14471">To-day, as never before</p>

<p id="id14472">Treading close upon the heels</p>

<p id="id14473">Tried by this standard</p>

<p id="id14474">True it is</p>

<p id="id14475">True, there are difficulties</p>

<p id="id14476">Truly it is a subject for astonishment</p>

<p id="id14477">Two things are made very clear</p>

<h4 id="id14478" style="margin-top: 2em">U</h4>

<p id="id14479">Under all the circumstances</p>

<p id="id14480">Under these favoring conditions</p>

<p id="id14481">Under this head</p>

<p id="id14482">Undoubtedly we may find</p>

<p id="id14483">Unfortunately it is a truth</p>

<p id="id14484">Unless I could be sure</p>

<p id="id14485">Up to this moment I have stated</p>

<h4 id="id14486" style="margin-top: 2em">V</h4>

<p id="id14487">Very strange is this indeed</p>

<h4 id="id14488" style="margin-top: 2em">W</h4>

<p id="id14489">We all agree as to</p>

<p id="id14490">We all feel the force of the maxim</p>

<p id="id14491">We all in equal sincerity profess</p>

<p id="id14492">We almost shudder when we see</p>

<p id="id14495">We are approaching an era</p>

<p id="id14497">We are assembled here to-day</p>

<p id="id14498">We are beginning to realize</p>

<p id="id14499">We are bound to give heed</p>

<p id="id14500">We are constantly being told</p>

<p id="id14501">We are fulfilling what I believe to be</p>

<p id="id14502">We are in the habit of saying</p>

<p id="id14503">We are met to-night</p>

<p id="id14504">We are not able to prove</p>

<p id="id14505">We are not disinterested</p>

<p id="id14506">We are quite unable to speculate</p>

<p id="id14507">We are told emphatically</p>

<p id="id14508">We are tolerably certain</p>

<p id="id14509">We believe with a sincere belief</p>

<p id="id14510">We can but pause to contemplate</p>

<p id="id14511">We can imagine the amazement of</p>

<p id="id14512">We can not but be struck with</p>

<p id="id14513">We can not escape the truth</p>

<p id="id14514">We can not have this too deeply fixed</p>

<p id="id14515">We can not too highly honor the temper of</p>

<p id="id14516">We can not wonder</p>

<p id="id14517">We can only applaud the sentiment</p>

<p id="id14518">We can only bow with awe</p>

<p id="id14519">We can presume</p>

<p id="id14520">We can remember with pride</p>

<p id="id14521">We can see to some extent</p>

<p id="id14522">We continually hear nowadays</p>

<p id="id14523">We deeply appreciate the circumstances of</p>

<p id="id14524">We do not quarrel with those</p>

<p id="id14525">We do not question the reality</p>

<p id="id14526">We do well to recall</p>

<p id="id14527">We easily persuade ourselves</p>

<p id="id14528">We feel keenly about such things</p>

<p id="id14529">We grope blindly along</p>

<p id="id14530">We have a firm assurance</p>

<p id="id14531">We have a right to claim</p>

<p id="id14532">We have an overpowering sense</p>

<p id="id14533">We have been accustomed to</p>

<p id="id14534">We have been told by more than one</p>

<p id="id14535">We have come together to-night</p>

<p id="id14536">We have great reason to be thankful</p>

<p id="id14537">We have heard lately</p>

<p id="id14538">We have here plain proof</p>

<p id="id14539">We have need to examine</p>

<p id="id14540">We have no means of knowing</p>

<p id="id14541">We have no other alternative</p>

<p id="id14542">We have not yet solved the problem</p>

<p id="id14543">We have sought on this occasion</p>

<p id="id14544">We have the evidence of this</p>

<p id="id14545">We have the good fortune to-night</p>

<p id="id14546">We have to admit</p>

<p id="id14547">We have witnessed on many occasions</p>

<p id="id14548">We hear it is said sometimes</p>

<p id="id14549">We hear no complaint</p>

<p id="id14550">We heartily wish and mean</p>

<p id="id14551">We hold fast to the principle</p>

<p id="id14552">We laugh to scorn the idea</p>

<p id="id14553">We may all of us agree</p>

<p id="id14554">We may be permitted to remember</p>

<p id="id14555">We may contemplate with satisfaction</p>

<p id="id14556">We may have a deep consciousness</p>

<p id="id14557">We may indeed consider</p>

<p id="id14558">We may not know precisely how</p>

<p id="id14559">We must also look</p>

<p id="id14560">We must constantly direct our purpose</p>

<p id="id14561">We must not be deceived</p>

<p id="id14562">We must not mistake</p>

<p id="id14563">We must realize conscientiously</p>

<p id="id14564">We must remember</p>

<p id="id14565">We need no proof to assure us</p>

<p id="id14566">We need not look far for reasons</p>

<p id="id14567">We need not trouble ourselves</p>

<p id="id14568">We of this generation</p>

<p id="id14569">We often hear persons say</p>

<p id="id14570">We ought in strict propriety</p>

<p id="id14571">We pride ourselves upon the fact</p>

<p id="id14572">We rightly pay all honor</p>

<p id="id14573">We see in a variety of ways</p>

<p id="id14574">We shall all doubtless concede</p>

<p id="id14575">We shall be blind not to perceive</p>

<p id="id14576">We shall do well to remember</p>

<p id="id14577">We shall have no difficulty in determining</p>

<p id="id14578">We should be convinced</p>

<p id="id14579">We should contemplate and compare</p>

<p id="id14580">We should dread nothing so much</p>

<p id="id14581">We should lend our influence</p>

<p id="id14582">We should not question for a moment</p>

<p id="id14583">We should not, therefore, question</p>

<p id="id14584">We stand astonished at</p>

<p id="id14585">We stumble and falter and fall</p>

<p id="id14586">We take it for granted</p>

<p id="id14587">We will not stop to inquire</p>

<p id="id14588">Weighty as these conditions are</p>

<p id="id14589">Well, gentlemen, it must be confessed</p>

<p id="id14590">Well may we explain</p>

<p id="id14591">Well, now, let us propose</p>

<p id="id14592">Well, that being the case, I say</p>

<p id="id14594">Were I to speculate</p>

<p id="id14595">What are the precise characteristics</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

<h4 id="id16015" style="margin-top: 2em">Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h4>

<p id="id16016">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p id="id16017">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h4 id="id16022" style="margin-top: 2em">Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h4>

<p id="id16023">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p id="id16024">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org</p>

<p id="id16025">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p id="id16026">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p id="id16027">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate</p>

<h4 id="id16028" style="margin-top: 2em">Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h4>

<p id="id16029">Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p id="id16030" style="margin-top: 2em">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p id="id16031" style="margin-top: 2em">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:</p>

<p id="id16032">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://www.gutenberg.org<br>
</p>

<p id="id16033">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
